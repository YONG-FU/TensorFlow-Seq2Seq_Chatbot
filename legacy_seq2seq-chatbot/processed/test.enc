Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
You have my word.  As a gentleman
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
What's normal?
What?
But you hate Joey
That's not
Daddy, I --
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Will Bogey get bent?
Her favorite uncle
He's pretty!
Assail your ears for one night.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
What 're you talking about?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Sure
What'd you do to her?
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
Who's that?
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
You didn't
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
You -- covered in my vomit.
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Who?
No, you weren't
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
A soft side? Who knew?
Answer the question, Patrick
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had.  You know
Because you're making decisions for me.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Touch of the flu.
Have a great time, honey!
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
The Judgment is ours!
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
You can see for yourself.
I don't want you to wait for me.
What...?  Do I have so many already?
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I believed in you...
I suppose we're both old men now.
I knew you would.
What did they say about Granada before today?
May I speak freely?
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
You must be mad...!
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
What about Oleg?
No.  No way.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
So...the station is empty?
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Is he your boyfriend?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Who do you think, Chief?!
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
Yeah.
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
You know what that is, right?
What would you call her?
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
You thirsty?
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
Yeah.
I don't have a girlfriend.
I'm serious here.
So am I.
So...who's Nicky?
Eddie, are you okay?
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Yeah.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
How much money are you carrying with you?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
We are both from Prague.
Don't fool around.
How you erase this?
What is it?
You've got a call.
Alright.  Go ahead.
Yes...he's my friend.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
You okay?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
CONTINUED
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Yes.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Good morning. How's it going?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
What is it, Hal?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
CONTINUED
When are you coming home?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Are you quite sure?
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
Yes, Hal, what's up?
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Yeah.
Vodka.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
I'm candy...
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
You're gonna help us take him.
You got a name, cop?
You here to write my life story?
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
No way to start a partnership.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Thank you.
What do you think?
We eat when I say we eat.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash?
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
Why?
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
I don't think your gun's loaded...
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
You sure you want me to?
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
You're impossible...
Who the hell are you?
Hard man to live with.
Hey...
We got a lot to talk about.
Let her go.
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
What are you doing?
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
Who?
I don't have time... I need to know.
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
You little sleaze bag!
6... 5...
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
What mission?
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
Apipoulai!
Love...
Where you going?
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
I'm so tired...
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
I love you.
Why the gun?
Hello?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
Tom...
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
You couldn't?
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
You're killing me...
What you see is what I got, mister.
I'm telling you...
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
I'd rather you didn't.
What are these for?
What are you... ?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Any good?
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
Yeah.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
Stop talking.
Where?  Show me where.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
Of what sort?
Never mind how I found you.
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
You almost went over your limit.
Big date tonight?
How long you been working there?
Three, four years.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
I don't know, where are yours?
A daughter.
What's this?
Uh huh, pleasure.
He succeeded.
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Okay.
Yes... ?
I had to ask.  I apologize.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
Her belongings?
I can't go back to sleep again.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
You in a hurry?
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
That obvious, huh?
Not really.
Then what else can we do?
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
T-T-Thanks Alice...
I don't get it.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
Nice neighborhood.
Hey...wake up.
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
Sobering...
Alice!
Did everyone call everyone?
What?
Then get out!
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
Where are you going?
Poor woman...
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
Vomit?
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
Yes?
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Something wrong?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
There's got to be an explanation!
Huh?
Right <u>at</u> him?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
Always has been.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
He's on to us!
We bought you.
Sun's gettin high.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
Don't mind if I do.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
Open the door, will ya?
Open the door. We're late.
I guess they're stupid.
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
It's not that.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Yes.
Yes.
How about a Big Mac?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Okay.
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Something bugging you?
Yeah. A few things.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
Yeah, lots.
I still don't understand --
For a while.
How's she doing?
I'm sorry about what I said.
Yeah. I mean that.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
There's a furnace.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
What?
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
Jack?
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Rolfe.
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Which is?
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
Not particularly.
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
I don't drink coffee.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
It was the experience of a lifetime.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
You're pointing a gun at me.
I know he left you behind.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
Finally, we can bargain.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
Can't it wait?
No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
Did they say anything about my family?
One.
This is the President.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
Thank you for calling the white House...
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
You give me ulcers.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
What?
Ted, what's wrong?
Who's that, Ted?
Elaine.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Ted!
Elaine, what's going on?
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
What will happen to him, Ted?
Are you afraid?
Set!
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Roger.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
Captain Oveur?
You folks need any help?
All right, it's a matter of death.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
Do you want to talk about it.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
Elaine!
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
What's his problem?
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Excuse me, Sister?
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
That's right.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
In there.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
And that fits?
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Your mother mates out of season.
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
Was.  Divorced.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
Uh, George...
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
What is it?
Only holds five.
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Yeah, Sykes?
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
Get outta there!
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
How long until it blows?
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
If I go.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
Well, I mean...I know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  Let's move cautiously.  First, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
Still nothing from the colony?
What is it?
Alive?
We got problems.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Locked.
Hicks, don't let him leave.
What did you say?
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Don't go!  Please.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Don't bother.
Sir -
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
Yes!
Why not?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
Oh, leave me alone.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Well, don't do that again!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
No. Don't answer it!
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
Then he didn't send you?
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
I was at hand.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
What a strange young man.
May I try it?
Why not?
Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry?
What is it?
Would you tell me why?
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
How many pupils do you have?
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker.
Really? What is it he's writing?
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Yes?
Sssh!
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
Mio caro Adone.
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
Did you like it, then?
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
I have come to commission work from you.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
The Fire.
Yes.
Do you want to rest a bit?
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Mozart -
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
How well are you trained in music?
Ah - you've heard that?
Did you try?
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
But not his body.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
Dr. Hirsch?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
Could you get here without any trouble?
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
My best friend. My very best friend.
That's easy enough.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
I was dreaming again?
I would think so.
Of course.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
The zoo?
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
But...
What?
Hello, Benjamin.
No.
No.
No what?
He all right?
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
Alex?
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
That's a wolf's head.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
Say, David...
It's in front of us.
I'll tell you when we get there.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
I'm going completely crazy.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
It's you, David.
What?!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Jack, are you really dead?
What do you think?
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
Yes?
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Oh.
Remember the Alamo?
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest—
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
No kidding?
Where's Matt?
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust—
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks—
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Much better this morning, thank you.
Excuse me—
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Longer.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Good morning, Helen.
Mr. Sampson . . .
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
Oh, Matt . . .
Did you talk to him?
Mr. Williams . . .
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
Where's Charlie?
This is healing?
How'd they --
I'm sorry, Cole.
Damn!
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
But if we take their money and supplies...
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
Sure, cousin.
They gonna rush us?
Boys...
Such as?
Web's dead.
That just might work.
You know him?
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
That he was.
Did you kill Yankees?
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
I beg your pardon?
Don't swear.
Yes?
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
I'm not hanged yet.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
Now let's have a drink.
You okay, Jesse?
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
I guess so.
Well, not exactly.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
Why, yeah.
Really?
Really!
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Good.
Just perfect.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
Your men knew the risks.
This is him.
How did you know?
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
What is that?
Uh huh.
Luis is a despicable twit.
I'm ignoring you.
It's a plain end. I think.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Really?
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
I want a firm commitment.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
But what about the past? Our past?
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
Can I help you?
I think you should go now.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
Uh huh.
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Leaving what?
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
We are totally booked.
I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
You don't like this, I take it?
What is it?
Yes, Patrick?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
What...No! Put it in the carton.
No. Flattering, but no.
Well.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
No. I'm okay.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
Who do you ask?
Bad habit.
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
That's so typical, isn't it?
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
Well, I could he wrong.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
Great, yes, I'd like that.
Not a big music fan, eh?
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
No, Owen.
You think so?
You are a fanatic.
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
What're you -- what?
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
...Why?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
Right... What's that mean again?
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
You know a lot about art, I guess.
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
It's okay. Really.
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
Talk about work? Never!
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
Keep looking.
You're famous around here.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Cool!
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
You're compulsive.
...Milo?
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
You mean -- break in?
I told Teddy about you.
What'd he say?
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
Did you tell Alice?
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Come in.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Thank you.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Be careful.
Yes?
Thank you, Basil.
What's the other?
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Why did you leave so soon?
Why?
Let's go get him!
I hate having my picture taken.
I haven't had fun like that since college.
Oh, yes you are.
Not in the Nineties.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
Indeed.
Likewise.
Noooooooooooooo!
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
Hi.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
No, he's really evil.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
Then who wins?
How curious ...
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
Who?
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
But -- why?
Choices?
Steed, we really must be --
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
I must say, you look more your old self --
Is that written in his shoe?
That's what we were working on.
I'm playing to win.
You first.
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
Have you any place in mind?
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
You're not venturing alone, surely.
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
The last one you'll ever see.
I was at Harrow ...
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
The car for Debbie?
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Hello?
Yes I did.
Fine. How's everything going?
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
I don't know... I just feel scared.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
You better not have too much joy.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
So, Larry, how have you been?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
The phone made me do it!
No, Brett, I...
Where the hell is he?
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
Now, don't get into any trouble.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
-- He killed people --
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
Goddamn it Stephen!
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Everybody did.
-- What are you doing here?
Anything else?
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
With grenadine, right?
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Brian. What's wrong?
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
What is --
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
I want another shot, Sir.
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
Every little boy's fantasy.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Where's Sean?
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
-- You remember.
I treated you better.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
Shadow.
Who's this?
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
-- Burn them.
It knows us. This one knows us.
I forgive you.
Large?
This psycho can.
What case?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
You truly are a dancing fool.
Yeah!
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
What do you do?
And another thing, you better stay away from my sister or you better...
You might be right.
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
I won't do it anymore.
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
Who are the other characters?
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
Nobody told me anything.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
I'm in till the end.
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
What is your problem?
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
You've said that already.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
What is this?
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
How so?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
No.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
...I heard different, thought that was...
...like grits and butter...
I fell out of my bed last night.
I feel a song a comin' on.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
Y'know what?
What?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
Has he sent the challenge yet?
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
I'll match any man with the sword.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
Good night, my little darling.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Bill Styles...
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
He is the only one unaccounted for.
You framed-him...
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
I'm not telling you what happened.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
I didn't shoot West --
Right?
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Why?
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
I... I don't know...
No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
I didn't --
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
Home, I'm done.
What the hell are you talking about --
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
Ah, Christ
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
He's in interrogation?
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
Something like that. You?
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Buttfucks the cabin?
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
That's a fantastic idea --
You couldn't have known --
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
So you took off your shirt?
It won't work --
Wrong answer --
Thank God...
I used it to start the fire --
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
Sir, yes, sir!
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
Yes!
The poet? What ever happened to him?
No.
What did she look like?
Yeah.
Helping people makes me happy.
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last name is different.  You married.
I never knew.
I like your stories.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
Okay.
What did she say?
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
The river.
Daffodils?
This is it? The whole vault.
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
How is he?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Would you say you understand Josephine?
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
That's not a burn.
Say thank you.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
What? What are you doing?
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
Uh. Do you like England?
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
Yes.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
They go. John. They go.
You don't understand anything.
What? No you're not..
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
Have you got your passport?
So uh...
Shut up. I'm not listening.
You don't want to talk about it.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
I don't have nothing.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
She's alive!! She is not dead?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
You know you can come under the blanket.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
Just wanted to see.
Yes?
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
Sure.
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Rose... please...
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
Teh... Tehronne?
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
Now you get up! And you get in my house!
Let go of me...
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
We drinkin' buddies now?
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
Don't know if God wanna see me.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.
Not like that.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
So...  That your first time?
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
Holy shit!
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
I'm a what?
Thought you had a man for that.
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
Nick... You up?
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
This the right place?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
High spirits, desire, commitment.
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
Give us a break...
Why the hell not?
I've continued working on the case!
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
What'd I tell you?
She disappeared... shit!
Because he knows how to get to our man.
How many men?
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
Ich said you left.
Gaiijin?
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
Keep the change.
Yeah.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
You trust me?
If I say no?
Where?
Not to be trapped.
One man.  He must be good.
I want more life, fucker.
Also extraordinary things.
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
Like what?
Yeah.
Well, when do you get paid?
When might that be?
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
Not if it works.
How old am I?
I'm great.  I mean, I know I'm not really great, but I feel just great.  How you like my new suit?
No.  I got a problem.
Huh huh.
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
What shows?
Are you for real?
Jeezus!
I'd never get an abortion.
I told you I'd come back.
Do you dream?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
They could clean around the arrangement.
Ten years.
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
You know what I think?
Is this to be an empathy test?
Yes.
Discreetly.
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
A tortoise.  What's that?
Know what a turtle is?
Of course.
Pris.
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
What makes you think so?
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
What is it?!
It's Perry!
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
I can't, it's yours.
Why are you doing that?
Thank-Q!
I think it's the eyes.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Why doesn't it never work out?
Two weeks.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
A wife?
It didn't used to be that way.
Yes, ma'am!
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
In the house?
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
The guy with the underpants!
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Do I look crazy?
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
That's ridiculous.
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
Adam?!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
What?
It was at least as good as the sky.
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
What?
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
A card?
What's baseball?
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
What's the capitol?
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Why not? He has great pants.
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
And thanks for always being happy!
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
Yes?
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
Yes!
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
He's smart.
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
Oh, yes.
You're serious, aren't you?
I see "elegant."
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Yes, you do!
Or have perfect table manners.
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
Oh, no!
Gay.
Where?!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
See you Tuesday, Frank.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Come into the study a minute.
No, not at all.
You're all through with this now?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
That oughta do it.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Do you like that?
Yes.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
No.
Don? Are you in with them?
Come in.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Frank would open you.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I did. Are you?
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Look at these. What are these?
Can I feel 'em?
Go where?
On a ride.
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Where are they?
I don't know.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
You really want to do this, don't you?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
He got a little jealous.
You saw a lot in one night.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Who, me? Why should it?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
Okay, okay.
What am I going to do?
Jeffrey!!
Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Okay.
What is it?
You want to dance?
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
NO.
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Come on out a minute, okay?
What did he bring him in for?
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Are ya ready?
Yes sir.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
Yeah, well...
It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for.
What?! What are you doin'?
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
Oh, Jesus.
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
A bit.
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
It is your corrupt we claim.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
My, my...
It was... It was...
New hitman wants to leave his mark
What about one guy with two guns?
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Witness?
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
Right now.
Hey. You don't know that shit for sure.
Hello?
Hello?
Liberating isn't it?
Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
Yes.
Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
Yes.
Yes.
Don't do this my son.
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
Where are you going?
But he didn't say anything.
Is it back in?
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
There's another stocker, right?
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
What's wrong with him?
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
I'll just say it.
You owe me fifty bucks.
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
We said 48 hours.
This morning.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
I know that. But --
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
I'll get him.
You're living on a sailboat?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
Does it float?
Scale the --
Nice to meet you.
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
How does that feel?
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
See you.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
Why don't you just tell them the truth. Those belong to my neighbor Phil.
You think he got my license plates?
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Sixty days?
Were you adopted, Bob?
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
What do you mean?
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
No.
So who's going to know?
I can't believe you said that.
I think we might of scared her.
Bob.
His name was Swifty?
Is he chasing us?
My brother's in jail.
The weed.
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
That could be anybody's.
How long has he been in there?
I don't know.
This could be a trap.
Bullshit.
That's OK.
I know it, man. Hang on.
I couldn't hear anything.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
He said what?
The grammar?
Oh, yeah.
Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.
Never heard of it.
That's not gonna fly.
Did he say anything to you?
Had to be done.
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
It was staged?
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
You called it in?
-- what? --
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
I should be better by now.
But we were so careful.
He was at the campground yesterday.
So...
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
What?
-- where? -
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
My first job.
That's a lie!
Okay, Jason, your move.
Sounds like a threat.
Here?
This is everything? Is there.
How long have you worked for the agency?
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
So?
Do we know what this says?
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
But if we have not caught Wallace --
So I did! And what was so important about it?
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
Thank you for inviting.
Nor I!
You scare me.
Tonight then.
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
Come, it'll help you sleep.
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
What is it?
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Anything.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
What happened?
I found these. The others are still in storage.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
Are you hurting her?
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Where are my goddamn books?
But I... I need those books.
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Not since we were kids.
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
What do you mean?
Different? How?
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Which is?
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
I don't get it.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
Then you think it might have worked out?
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
We'll find out soon enough.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Smells like sex in here.
Look what you made me do!
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Monsieur Rick?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
So you decided to go to America.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
You want my advice?
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
-- Tonight he forgot.
Here you are.
I'd better be going.
It's not for sale at any price.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
Not an easy day to forget.
And I was wondering.
Yes, of course, we --
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
I didn't count the days.
Has it got a wow finish?
I don't know the finish yet.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
But why my name, Richard?
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
What happened with Rick?
-- Yes?
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
Be careful.
Well then, perhaps you also ---
What for?
Your work.
Good morning.
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
Well, this might come in handy.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
We'll be there.
-- Thank you.
And that is?
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
But everybody's having such a good time.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Manages what?
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
What friend?
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
Uh huh.
Where were you last night?
What is your nationality?
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
No.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Yeah, boss?
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
You've had today's water.
Why do they have to die for me?
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
Had a package to deliver.
I've got lots of time.
Four four.  A record.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
"We're" not over-reacting.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
I love you, Chuck.
You too.
When's the next Jumbo?
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
You're Chuck Noland.
Thought you were going to bring her.
Trying.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
What's going on down there?
You what?
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
Forget it.
You are one sick fucker.
I beat the odds!
How about we go somewhere else?
Then I wasn't beautiful.
They just want you to hire some new help.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
What's she so emotional about?
So, Mrs...
At least you were never lonely.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
You don't understand! It's her father...
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
But did you know him?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Did you know your mother better?
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
A B-24 Liberator.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
Then it's malaria?
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
Tough day?
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
It's not true.
So what? We hide, right?
You know what we're doing with the money.
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
So that's it...
Because you killed one of my crew.
How much?
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Look at you, you skinny prick.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
Uh-huh.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
He was looking out for you.
You tell them the "Tale".
We're working for the King.
Escorts!
Do you have a ticket?
King ain't gonna like this.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
Still time.
The King, huh? Nice going.
Special Agent?
What do you want?
Maybe another time.
I'll take you up on that.
The Indian rope-trick.
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
She went back to South Africa.
I thought it was you. It's the hair!
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
I couldn't resist them.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
What's the time?
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
Marion, stop this.
I'm on at nine.
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
I hate public transport.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
Oh hello.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
The debts.
Absolutely not.
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
They mean it.
Let it go.
Is it yes?
Do you?
She's my baby.
You're talking about complicity.
Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
No thanks.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
You can start Monday week.
Oh. What's wrong now?
I hope it's not the oven again.
Key? Key? What is the key?
Where is the key?
It didn't go off.
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
You are false data.
Hello, bomb.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
What I'm getting at is this: the only experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And this data is merely a stream of  electrical impulses which stimulate your computing center.
...nine seconds...
Yes, Doolittle.
In a second.
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
No kidding?
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Yeah.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
None of your business.
How're ya doin', Max.
I live here... Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
No way.
I ain't mad at you...
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Mommy, I'm scared.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
You got a lotta nerve.
You need to get out more.
You lost me.
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
How much do you know?
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
You said you could help.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
I would've come sooner, but...I didn't... How're you doin'?
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
But she does work here?
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
Just give it to me.  I'll remember.
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
Yeah.
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
Right, the big one-oh.
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
I'll give it my best shot.
Easy Sketchy.
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
For a change.
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
What's in Sandusky?
Any luck?
Shit, that dork is Jam.
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Sunday, but...
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Dude, this is all I got.
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
What's gone?
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
A bustier?
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
Well... the thing is, nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
Like a spear.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
How can you do that?
Where did you come from?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
You're weird.
That was a compliment.
With, like, images?
So, we call them... IMGs.
What? How long was I asleep?
My mom is gone.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
Do you get to meet Ed?
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Grandma Death.
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
Four times... so far.
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
I... I was playing with fire.
But you were punished.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
I think now that he might...
Because I'm so horny.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
Because you tell Mom everything.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
If that's what you think is necessary.
Our son just called me a bitch.
What else?
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
Rose.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
There's no rule!
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
Okay.
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
Bye mom.
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
Yeah...
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
My dress'll reek.
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
Here I am, Father.
My dear President...  read it back...
I'll have to enclose the check first.
Yes, sir. 
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
Well - what is he now?
I don't call him, I whistle.
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
Did you shoot the rapids?
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
She did.
Send in the next girl. 
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
Was it -- swine?
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
Your Excellency!
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
Uncle, you can't do this!
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
I found it.
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
Never mind that, I want my man!
Now I think we really do understand one another.
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
Has the response picked up?
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Alas, no.
Oh no?
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
y-y-yes--
You're English.
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
What's this?
Yyess.
Yes!
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Yes.
Say "Mmmerrick."
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
You did not ask me.
The hospital?
Who are they of?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
Yes, John.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
No, he's very upset about something.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
A dressing bag.
Very smart indeed.
It's all right! It isn't happening!
But you LOVED her all the same...
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
But you don't realize....
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
Yes -- I believe you do.
How?
REALLY?
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
Well, how d'you think I feel?
He wants to kill US!
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
About raping me?
Well you started it.
What are you talking about?
We're missing all the fun...
I want to die...  No, I don't!
What are YOU doing here?
SHUT UP!
So?
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
You need to say a bit more than that!
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
Same thing, isn't it?
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
Made by YOU, Loki!
So did my father and his father before him.
But it's a responsibility...
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
Not now, Sven...
I must KILL! Kill!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
Well... I'm game.
Shut up.
Yes, Mum.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
Yeah, you told me that later.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
No, it was lovely.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
Oh, Tangerine.
Well, I didn't want to assume.
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
My name's Clementine, by the way.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
I'm not nuts.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
It's okay.
I like to read.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
It's pretty.
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Yeah?
Yeah.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
I want to have a baby.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
I don't think we're ready.
You're not ready.
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
I'm right here.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
I dropped you off after. You said --
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Well, you're married.
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
You had the whole human race pegged.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Male or female?
What are you doing?
Tomorrow?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
I just walked in.
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
I might be making a mistake.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
What? What do you mean?
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
How was it?
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Oh! Great. That's great!
So you think the dissertation will get published?
Stan... c'mon...
I know. Anyway --
See you later, alligator.
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
And after that?
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
It's no big deal.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
The voltage looks fine.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
This one's history. Moving on...
I know who you are.
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
I don't.
You don't?
You're political, then?
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
Whose fault was that?
Why? Why do you have to go?
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
From what?
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
You weren't there. I saw it.
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
What happened?
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
90 over 50 and falling... .
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
What does?
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
...how's the client?
It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
What about it?
Explanation?
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
You're lying...!
Jesus...
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
Captain Miller, you copy?
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
Thank you.
Captain, we got a problem.
What is it, Smith?
We can take the filters from the Clark...
You've got to listen...
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
What's going on in there, Starck?
Blow it up?
...repeat, we're armed...
Claire...
Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it.
Almost got it.
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean?
How'd you know it was me?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
Where is Reed?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
I can't take this.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
How long was I out?
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Ben. Are you okay?
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Now what is up with that?
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Stop it.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
And if he's not...?
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Feeling better?
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day, checking every variable --
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
This is how I dress all the time.
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
I'm just guessing.
Well... it's true.
No.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Are you really a virgin?
You first.
I think we're making a lot of noise.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
Did you go home and get it?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Well, I've gotta be running.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
You're losing it, Damone.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Yes.
I thought he was out of town.
Seen the new Playboy?
What should I do?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
It was okay.
It was nice.
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
I paid for it and everything.
Yeah, like maybe never.
I don't know. I guess so.
What's that?
Well, you'll find out next year.
If you graduate.
The point sounds fine.
That's a nice shirt.
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
You keep them.
This is a nice car.
...I've got to go home.
What's April 16th?
John Bonham?
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
This is my granddaughter...
I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one?  How about some ether?
...and we're chock full of that!
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.
Yes!
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
Who the hell would you call?
And the rest of 'em?
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
Why do you take shit from him?
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
It's much safer in there, sweety.
What? Really?
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
Open?
Move slow and move quiet.
We all have to be strong, right?
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
What're you doing?
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
You know what I mean.
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
Right now we have to be practical.
...Yes.
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
No?
Let's get out of here! I'll lose my job!
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
Bye, baby.
You wrote it, didn't you?
Is Kaminski a Communist?
What do I do, Dad?
You really want to go?
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
Thank you.
I'm going back to the hotel.
But, Kurt, I...
Oh, Kurt!
Name?
You can always come see it in London.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Harry.
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
Don't start, Farmer.
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
No, Harry, I can't -- 
What?
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
I think I need a little air.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
Haven't you heard what I said?
No!
It ain't for lack of trying.
Huh?
Frances, I'm warning you...
You're kidding.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Kill me and have done with it.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
A brain. Extremities.
Poor William! What indignant tears!
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
What kind of God is He to will this?
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
And you?
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
Are you having me on?
Do you really think I'm mad?
Yes? And?
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
How is it you come to be here?
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
How come you're leaving?
You know what I said, though.
I had to.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
Just my son and I.
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
So let's do it.
What's this guy's problem?
You don't believe in suicide.
Why did they block the door again?
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Come again?
Who's this?
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Pass.
He backed down.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
We have to go back for Daddy!
How many bullets left, kid?
Should I use the last bullets on us?
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
Hot goddamn day!
Whatsamatter?
Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
Did you even to try to negotiate?
What'd ya see?
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
She's in the other room.
No, I didn't.
We are?
Far out.  Where are my glasses?
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
That's what you think?
My shit is together.
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
Yeah, it's mine.
Wow...
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this.  Not this article, not --
I'm not sure what --
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
I'll work on it, ma'am.
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
I can make this wall without --
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
I was looking for him earlier, but...
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't...
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
And how do you know that?
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
That's a good story.
At first.
Sorry, didn't mean to --
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
Just askin'
'Cool?
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
Maybe half.  Not even.
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
We're fucked.
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
I take it this file is still open.
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
What are you doing?
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
So you made it.
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
...he's pregnant.
Nesting?
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
My life sucks.
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
And you're beautiful...
Call me Charlie.
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
Are you sure? How do you know?
Sure.
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
Calm down everybody.   We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender.
We stop we die. Keep holding the thruster down Tommy!
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
What?  What?
You were holding it upside down weren't you?
And note the sucked in gut.
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
Why didn't you stop at the market?
A boy comes to the door.
Those blue things ate everybody here?
Yes but, we were wondering-
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Brandon.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
What do you mean?
How did you come to that conclusion?
Shit! Go!
What?  Up?
Yes?
The enemy is matching velocity.
No, I'll kill you. .
We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
Your last name.
It's... I don't know.
I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
More to the left... Stay parallel...
Not a clue. You?
Tell them? About...
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
How does the rolling help, actually?
Yes.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
We pretend...
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
Commander...
What kind of signal?
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Because they're coming right at us.
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days.
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
No, my lord.
How old are you, Captain?
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
I'm so inclined.
Sir, I think no such thing.
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
Lafayette is a child!
Let's not over do it...
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
A grand scheme?
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
I... they look both the same.
I rode here, on my horse.
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
What is it, Marquis?
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
I want you to see our hospital.
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
George, you know I only love you, but...
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
Or, 'civilized'.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
What are you doing?
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
I say!
My daughter, I ask only...
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
I guess still in the locker.
No. What's this?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
Your who?
He's around someplace.
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
You know how to write one of these?
What money?
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
Man, I can't wait for you to be dead.
I can't do it.
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people –-
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
How 'bout another one for Mr. Zimm. A double.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
Who?
What?
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
You pack a gun?
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -– this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer –-
You got that on the brain, Harry. If you're so scared of 'em why'd you take their money to Vegas to begin with?
For a movie?
He drown?
What do you get out of this?
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
One we're producing.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
I'm up twelve grand today.
Who told you that?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
It's not one of these?
The door from the patio, in back.
You broke in?
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
You bet.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
Whatta you doing out there?
I'm going into the movie business.
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
Pick 'n' Save.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Oh, for Christ's sake –-
Lufkin. His... agent.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
Sixty pounds.
That's what it says.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
What's so great about Sweden?
I don't know. Tuesday?
Roger.
Roger?
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
How long?
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
On a passenger ship in 1953?
What do you propose?
What's slow?
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
That's what I call a payday.
That's a good thing?
What'd he look like?
What?
Did you see him?
Same. Any luck?
The same day she supposedly went down.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
That much I think we've already established.
Over the gold.
What happened?
What?
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
Greer to Murphy.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
Shut up.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
What's this?
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Guess.
Not the Maxine?
What is it now?
Pumpkin, are you in there?
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
Did you actually do this painting?
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
Uh-oh.
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
Hi Josh.
Do you want something to drink?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
When did I say I hated you?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Hi Enid.
God, what a bunch of retards...
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
This is so bad, it's almost good.
Why?
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
I know a party we could go to...
I totally, totally hate you.
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
Like what?
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers!  Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
...maybe we should be lesbos...
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
God, you're really obsessed...
You're insane.
Do you still want to do something tonight?
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
Nothing.
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Seymour does.
You still interested in that?
Yes.
Hey, where are you going?
Is this one any good?
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
Relax, Seymour, relax...
It's not hopeless...
I promise I'll take good care of it.
Really?
Oh yeah?
Aren't you going to get that?
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
Uh... sure... come in.
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
Yeah, sure. Of course.
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
What?
I dunno, I...
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
I am.
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Why? What did she tell you?
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
That slut!
You've never built in Africa.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
Yes he is.
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
Aren't we full of ourselves today?  I think it's because of the lion.
What did I do?
Samuel says you killed a lion.
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Good luck.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
Oh yes. But it takes time.
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
Everybody has a choice.
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Oh no.
Does he ever mention me?
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
Hello, Peter.
So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
His name is Oscar.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
Oh, hello, Peter.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
Or we could do that.
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
That's not true.  It was 1620.
That's quite a story.
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
I command you.
These boys aren't playing around.
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
I'd like to have a stool specimen
Pretty impressive, huh?
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
No, I just thought --
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Is it a star?
Ready?  What is it?
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
You really don't act like a scientist.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
That's it.  Get out.
Then leave.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
Great rehearsal.
You heard it?
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
Is that a game?
I want you to have this. 
I don't believe in luck.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
Great!  How's it going?
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
Don't cross the beams.
I agree.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
What now?
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
What is it?
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
So do I.
How do you know?
Egon, how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
What?  What popped in there?
Mmmhmmm.
Stantz?  You okay in there?
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
I want that bastard dead!
I am their hero!
They won't break this one.
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
He killed his father and then my family...
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
Death is a very light thing for you.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
You're living at home now. Is that right?
No.
I want to go home.
We won't. Let's go inside.
Benjamin -- do they know you?
I do.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
Come in.
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
You really will?
I just don't think it would work.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
Are you listening?
There is a great future in plastics. Think about it. Will you think about it?
What's that?
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
What did you do to her?
I want you out of here.
Will you bring it in to me?
What?
What?
Yes sir?
Where is your luggage?
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Thank you.
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
What do you think of me?
Sit down, Benjamin.
Pardon?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
Yes.
No.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Yes?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Yes.
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Now?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Oh -- yes. Wood?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
Oh.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
Neither.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
What novel did you read.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
He's asleep.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
No we don't.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
What?
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Why did you do that?
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
At college.
Oh my God.
That's enough.
Good.
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
Thank you.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
You'll never be young again.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
Why?
Benjamin Braddock.
What's happening?
Have you a minute now?
Well?
No.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
Have you seen it?
That.
You?
Where downstairs?
Yes -- I'd love to.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
You are beautiful!
I want to be alone.
That's a silly joke.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
And now?
Do you understand?
For Vienna?
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
It's always so quiet here.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
I must have made a mistake.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
Telegrams?
Any letters?
This gentleman can have my room.
Oh!
You're tired. I can see that.
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
Everything?
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
Am I!
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
Definitely off.
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
All right.
You've decided against the merger?
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
You see -- what we are interested in --
But, Madam. cannot do that.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
What is this insolence?
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
Motherhood.
Permanent damage.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
What? He's going to be all right!
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
Why? What's wrong?
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
What's up?
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
I tripped over a chair.
What's that?
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
You must have some money.
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
I can't. I just left home.
Mm?
I want to know everything about you.
Mama!
I'll pay Lilly back, don't you worry about that.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
Working the what?
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
And hello to you, too.
Bullshit!
What's that?
That's natural.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
Sure. Let's get it over.
Ate the gun. Oh.
Well, thank you. And thank them.
The cemetery...
I can be real stiff.
That's it?
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
It's Amy Kramer.
My god...
I think someone broke into my house.
Nothing.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
Get on the bus.
Why not?
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
You look kind of cold.
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
I can't believe this is happening.
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
Whatever happened to women in back?
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
What if your parents come home?
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
What should I do?
Halloween.
Danny?!  Danny!
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
Who else knew I had the baby?!
Home is important to a man.
How all the magazines show tits today.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
First Nagasaki--now this.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
When?
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
I didn't know we had any women left.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
I dunno.
You never played a violin.
I know you think that.
They were enemies.  We were at war.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
You're hollow, like a woman.
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
Out!
Hello.
Ask it!
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
College?
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
"The sting."
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
I don't know.
Mhravitch.
They're not engaged.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Penelope!
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
Will you go to bed?
What kind of exercise?
Dad?
No.
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Can I help you, sir?
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
You don't even know me.
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
Shouldn't you lie down?
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
Nothing would please me more.
It's so--so stark.
Which one?
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
What then?
That's what you're supposed to say.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
The doctor.
What are you going to do?
Sneaking in the back door.
See how you've upset him.  He was so merry and hale before you came home.
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
No, we won't.  No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does.  Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
Help your mother find the bullet.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
We'll miss you so.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
I've literally got to run!
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
I thought she was a widow.
I'm going to have to report you to the Department of Health.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
What brought you back?
There's going to be no bloodshed here.  I know how he'll fight--the only way he can fight: with words. The truth.  Am I correct?
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
Mr. Ryan just borrowed my birthday cake.  I don't really know him.
Yes.
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
That goes double for me.
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
Thank you, kind sir.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
I hate that thing.
No.
Everything stays as it is!
My father!
He isn't any friend of Father.
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
How nice.
Marry me instead.
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
It's suicide!
He's not your son.
We met here earlier this evening.
Not true.
That's not true either--or needn't be, unless we make it true.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
No, just not the type.
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
No, I don't.
Yeah.
That's all you got, three girls?
Overpowering?
Are you sure it's all right?
I'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
Jesus.
What rate?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
Yeah, yeah, go on.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
Hello?
In G.R.? Why?
I've got a meeting...
What are you paying me for?
What have you found out?
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Is Marsha there?
Take it or leave it.
It's a short film.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What exactly do you have in mind?
Jake.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
Who's that?
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Okay, lady. Out.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
But there is a family resemblance.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Check.
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
And what do you do, my dear?
Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
It's very interesting.
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
What happened?
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
Where's that?
But they have.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Don't you advance on me.
Just like this.
- end where I began.
It's all right. It's organic.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
"And this too shall pass away."
Mother.
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
Is Sunshine your real name?
Do you play?
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
Yes. It does.
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
Well, maybe one.
Yes, sir.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Souvenirs?
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
He... he loved me.
She's done it.
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
What?
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
Who?
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
You were burned by some organic acid.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
It's almost over!!
Do you believe in hell?
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
Well, you did break out --
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
That voice --
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
No. Don't --
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Hey. You: think twice --
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
Are you sure about this?
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
Out? Out out?
Marco...
Cocky.
What about you?
Yes, I --
You fucking ass-holes.
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
Alright, let's give it another try.
Lucky man.
It's just a puzzle box.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
Let me alone, will you?
Just in time.
Come to Daddy.
This isn't happening.
Frank --
Who are you?
Help me.
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
Good.
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
Who?
You're hurting.
What kind of doors?
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
I said no.
Hi. I got soaked.
I was here this afternoon.
Why not?
Take it slowly.
You're done worse.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Are you all right?
I suppose that's right.
I... suppose so, yes.
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
I found a room.
YOU'D like my room.
I've forgotten.
Really?
What?
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
Yes!
Need any help?
I've been better.
Can I lend you a hand?
What's wrong?
Don't let them take me, Steve --
Really.
You gotta be kidding me.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Say it.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
Ehh.
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
Hey.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
Great.  Can I have it then?
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
Oh, hi.
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
Great.
Rob --!
What needs sorting out?
Yeah.
Shit!
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
Just the obvious stuff.
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
Just ask it!
You really think it would make a difference either way?
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
It's me.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
I guess I am.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
Pig died.
You're soaking.
What?
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
I mean it.
No.  Probably not.
Very persuasive.
Are you persuadable?
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
What's happenin'.
What's the -- hey, Liz --
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Yes.  You?
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
But you must have --
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
Naw.  Those are for us.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
I don't follow you.
-Okay okay.
Good reflexes.
Grave robbers?
Who?
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
Where?
He called you "MacLeod".
Not your concern.
That bothers you?
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
No.  I had to talk to you.
What's all that?
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
You kill with your left hand?
I haven't killed _you_.
What is it like?  Being you?
What is it you want?
Now there's a new topic.
A murder.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
Your name is Conor?
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
Does it change with me in the room?
I'm twenty-two.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
Aye.
But we cannot be killed.
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
I do not think I like the sound of that.
And you?
Of course.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
Romirez understood.  Not you.
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
Second musketeer.
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Where did you learn that?
Figure she's with him?
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
I knew his great-grandfather.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
Friend of yours?
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
It doesn't.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
We were very close.
Morning Mr. North
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
What's the idea of locking this?
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
No. Roy. Roy V.
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
Oh, it isn't like that.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
I lost my wallet.
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
Where'd she go?
Did you give her the money?
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
What's this?
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
You bet I've got a better offer.
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
You said it.
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
What do you think I am -- a crook?
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
Don't tell me you were worried!
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
It'll be Heaven!
Anything you want, Boss.
Who do you want?
There's money in it, Cooley.
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
Let's see the money.
They're always after me for interviews.
Me, too.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
I don't know --
Give me a hand with her, will you?
So have we!
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Gus, this --
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
I won't.
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
You'll take fifty and like it!
Look out, you --
First you got to sign a receipt. 
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Quiet, Mollie!
They'll get him! They'll get him!
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
What's from the Governor?
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
Pinkus.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
What's your hurry?
The door was locked.
Never let a rat creep up on you.
Why?
What's that?
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
I don't mind.
Bugger off.
Won't they have maps?
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
It's easy. I've done it.
Who with?
You're the biggest fibber.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
Who pays for them?
They might be.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
Has Sue got it right?
Well?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
You know it? It must be an old one.
What did he say?
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Up to six weeks, I think.
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
It was the best time of his life.
We did the decent thing.
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
Father, that's enough now
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
Cone.
Huh... what cone?
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
A dead one.
What?
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Yeah.
Perfect.
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
Thanks.
Fuck! We are fucked!
Why are we stopping?
Check this out.
Quiet.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
Oh, yeah.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Scattered, smothered and covered.
What? I didn't hear anything.
I don't hear anything.
What'd we here, Georgie?
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
What about the body you found?
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Aw, fuck.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle?
Oui. Perfect!
Of course not.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Like what?
Anyway. Come already to the point.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
I want our boy back.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
No.
My apologies, madam.
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
Shut up and tell me.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Nathan told my brother.
I'm going to miss you.
My God! The fork! The fork!
You do?
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
Yes.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
You are an animal.
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
Sure. Of course.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
How come?
Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
So he's doing okay?
Shit.
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
Pittsburgh?
How much do I owe you?
Make it twenty.
Yeah? Why?
You being cute?
Character.
Yeah. Sure, sure.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
Whaddya been so far?
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Seventy-five per cent.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Hello, Eddie.
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
You know everybody, don't you?
How good is he?
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
I'll beat him the next game.
How're the hands?
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
Maybe. You want to play?
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
How do you feel?
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
Talk to me, Charlie.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
With what?
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
HOW MUCH?!
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
How much?
You gentlemen care for a drink?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
What's the limit?
Gimme ten bucks.
Couple of bucks.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
Okay, friend. You're on.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
So why go to college?
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
I could always get us a bottle.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
Mm hmm.
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
Eggs. How do you like them?
What are you writing?
Who is it?
Is that what makes a winner?
A week? A year?
No, I want to walk.
Fifty-seven.
Why?
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
Is that a fact?
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
Mine.
Have you always had it?
Humans.
Who?
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
Son ... are you awake?
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
What's wrong, Ellen?
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
May I ask why?
Mr. Gardner, I --
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
Why?
Yes.  I can even read star maps.
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
His teacher brought him in to see me. Said he'd been acting up in class. Creating a disturbance.  I couldn't get a thing out of him.
Oh?
What's his family background?
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
What?
David? How'd you get this number?
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
Are you all right?
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
What're you talking about?
Not really...
Can't this thing go any faster?
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
Oh shit, we're late.
We're loose!
Where are they?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
A meteor?
What?
Dick-weed!
You know me...
Sorry for what?
Was his father stationed here?
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
I shouldn't have left her.
We're already over Mach 2!
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
I'm not leaving.
What do you want us to do?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
Your treat.
Ah, Venice...
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
The Word of God...
Schneider?
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
Are you expected?
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
An old man's dream.
You could be more right than you know.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
It must be one of these...
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
My room!
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
I'll never forgive myself --
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
If only I could have been with you.
Rats?
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
This is intolerable!
Come on, Dad. Come on!
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
Marcus would agree with me.
That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
Who are you?
That was seven hundred years ago.
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
Thank God all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing.
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
You don't like him do you?
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
Come one, what's wrong?
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
I like the service here.
India...
What'd he say?
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
Try me.
Who was it?
Me.
Your name is Al...
What street?
Who are you?
Are you threatening me?
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
Why not?
They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
You gotta help.
I did. I brought you back here.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
Now what.
Go out, take your first left.
Just walk down the hall?
Black suits and helmets.
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
What is it?
What do we do?
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
What about it?
Use my credit cards.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Now what?
Eating sushi?
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
Eat it?
Eat it.
Why not?
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
Don't just stand there, say something.
What?
What happened?
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
Now, where would I be?
It is my business. It's my name.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
Oh come on.
I don't know!
Is that all?
On what?
I don't trust her.
I've got an idea.
You're a lucky man.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
Let us get to the border!
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
Your memory.
What about it?
Well...
Who?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Not...complaining, actually.
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
What's what?
What do you do about what?
Is someone else here?
I'll be right there.
And you.
Why?
I am sort of scattered.
Can I help?
Promise you what?
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
And how'm I doing?
You're doing...Okay.
And you, what do you like?
There's not much to tell.
This business is over.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
What'd he steal?
Then why are you smiling like that?
And Dieter.
And you?
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
You've  been there?
Why not?
What did you tell them?
You can say that again. What do we do?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
What could you find in this place?
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
Is there anything else?
Wait.
Why?
Could I have it, please.
Mom...what are you doing here?
It'l be alright.
What does he know?
How long?
P.J.'s.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
What do you mean, what's it do?
Shit...
Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
Get me Wigand.
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
You're sure you want to do this?
Uh, what are those boxes?
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
Thomas Sandefur...
Thank you, Bob.
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
They're killing the Wigand interview...
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Get some perspective, Lowell.
Yeah...
...you fucked me!
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
We're there.
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
Yeah... Thank you.
I know what I have to know.
Far as you go where?
What do...
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
Hello. You there
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
They do this with impunity!
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
I told the truth!
ABC...?
You manipulated me into this...!
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
He doesn't seem to be listening...
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
What are you talking about?
Where you staying now?
Right.
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
Object to the form!
Is that a threat?
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
They hate each other --
Baby. You are so HOT!
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
That's his lawyer.
Objection, your honor!
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
What?
Asian? No.
What?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
So who'd you hire?
It sounded like a bell.
These are yours.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
But you don't agree?
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
He wants a reconciliation.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
Have you tried the duck?
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
And here I thought my mother was...
No.
I know.
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Miles? You're scaring me.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
What do you want?
STUFF.  Got a light?
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
It's not something I wanted either.
Pre-Castro.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
You used his credit card.
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
Well what does he want?
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
Mr. Massey --
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
Rex, please.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
I'm not sure.
She always looked out for me.
Wait... He wants to give her...?
I am very sorry.
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
Miles.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
The reward.
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself—long ago.
Do you love her?
What've you got against King Westley?
I knocked several times.
On the road.
Well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
Oh, come now—
He's marvelous!
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one—
You've made that quite evident—with all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Don't want to talk to—don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York—and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
Whadda you want!
Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
Oh, yeah?
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
I found it on the seat.
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
Now, just a minute—you can't—
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Like what?
Where'd you say the showers—and things—were? 
Where is the shower?
I thought maybe—uh—"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
I refuse to resign!
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
I wish you'd stop being playful.
Peter—
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
What!
What's the matter?
But what!
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
Amazing.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
ONE—TWO—THREE—FOUR—FIVE
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Get out!
Yeah.
Mr. Gordon—
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Get out of here!
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
What's the thousand bucks for?
Well, I got it, Joe.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
What?
Yeah.
A trumpet?
You send telegrams here?
Mebbe.
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Yeah.
Zeke.  Git!
Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
I can use a smart guy like you.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
You love them, don't you?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
What was his voice like?
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Did he pay?
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
I see.  And where did you drive?
Why Galveston?
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
I had the cause of death.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
I'm scared.
I want the truth.
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
Honey, some crackpot.  Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today!
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
Oh no!... How bad?
What are you driving at, boss?
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
Well, thanks for coming.
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
His name?
And he never hit you before?
I don't know if I should talk about this.
That's all you've had all this time?
And what would I have to do?
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
I understand.
Won't forget?
You were there for me.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
Look, man, I know I owe you --
We are. Don't worry about it.
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
What's her name?
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
I'd love one, but not there.
Why does it need to be dark?
Was she helpful?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
How'd you feel about it?
Well, hello.
What'd ya see?
"American President"
Does it happen to all men?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
Why?
You think he's got a thing for you?
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
Do you think they bought it?
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
That's Ordell's.
What if I plead guilty?
Most of the times.
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
Uh-huh.
Ever been tempted?
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
What did you do after that?
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I ain't goin anywhere near that money.
But you don't?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
What'd you care?
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
When did you get out of jail?
Susanville.
Bank robbery.
Want a Metrix?
So where did you go?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Yeah, down the end.
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
Then what?
What do I do?
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
Did you get it?
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
You couldn't just hit her?
Pretty sure.
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
Then what?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
Maybe the Feds got it.
Tell me.
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
What does she do for you?
Was she?
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
You know who this is?
How'd you find me?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
And you did that to protect my interest?
She's been there since Thursday night.
By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
No problem.
Take me home.
Della?
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
I could have told you that.
You know, you got a strange line here.
What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
But the paper ...
How long had that been going on?
I've seen it. It's all pain.
What? By myself?
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
I'm walking, aren't I?
It's good to see you.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
But I see them.
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
What was that?
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
Where are you?
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
I don't let anybody call me that.
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
When was the last time I said a word?
Where are we?
Why? What for?
What'd the doctor say?
He's coming right over.
Coming here?
Help me! Help me!
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
Are we in Brooklyn?
I love you, Jez.
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
Are you out of your mind?
Sit down, Jake.
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Mid-town mostly.
Goddamn you!
The Ladder?
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
I think I'm falling asleep.
I can't move.
They're awfully heavy.
Where's Wong?
Total delirium.
He'll never make it.
Push 'em back.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Count 'em on one hand.
Who is?
Why not?
I don't know what to do.
You've seen them?
I don't know. I don't know.
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
Died?
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
We can't lead him into the other hull!
Minimal.
Uh-oh.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
Yllo, what's your head count?
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
I couldn't save them.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
I think I had some when I was eight.
You're so bossy.
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Then open the doors!
What?!!
I gotta go back.
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Jason? He's on this ship?!
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
You got it.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
This is Matt Hooper...
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
C'mon. Middle appendix --
Where...?
Did you get him in the head?
He's trying to sink us!
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Michael! Come inside!
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Who are you?
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
You all right?
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
What's that, a ship?
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
I didn't know her.
Some friends and me took a house.
You're leaving?
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
Yep.
Well... is everything all right?
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White.
You know how I feel about her.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
So that's cool with you, then?
Charisma?
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
What a trip, man.
What? I'm not made of stone.
Nails? Really?
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
I rock a Harmony.
Why aren't you at work?
I wrote that.
We definitely want it to have junk.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
You've never been to a dance, have you?
I'm leaving Vanessa.
What?
No.
But I thought you'd be cool if...
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Is the baby okay?
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
No thank you. I'm off sex.
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
You mean like couples?
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
I sort of already have.
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
Is this Juno?
Dude, I'm pregnant.
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
You're not listening to me.
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
What do you make with that?
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
Yeah, downtown.
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
What's this?
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
What's your name, boy?
Henry Lucas.
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
So tell me... what happened here?
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
How do you know that?
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Brian I want him out of our car!
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
...Need a hand with those bags?
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
...You know what I mean?
Umm. Altogether?
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Shit.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
How?
Right.
You think?
Probably.
Telly.
Why?
It's no big deal, right?
Oh. You like her?
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
What are you talking about?
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Nah.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Where you goin' tonight?
Na.
You sure?
Man we fucked him up.
Sup. Sup.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Yeah. Come on.
She won't? Why not?
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
Tonight?
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
Do you care about me?
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
Because your a virgin?
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
Dance!
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Thanks.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
The pain. The fucking pain!
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Yeah.
I hate 'em.
Shh.
When are you gonna be back?
Hello?
Right.
I can't man.
Morpheus.
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
I wouldn't know.
Then let's narrow it down.
You still having a problem with this?
Ready for round two?
Who is this?
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
You'll find her.
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?
You don't understand.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
I just can't believe it.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
Is your dad here?
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
Six, eight hours tops.
I'm busy right now.
I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
Another one?  What word did he leave?
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
No.
I can check and call you back.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
Are you with the tournament?
Are you one of the players?
Yes.
When I was very young.
You.
Well, I think I've had enough.
They couldn't break the riddle.
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
Of course.
Why?
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
Peter...
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
You don't understand.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
We're almost married.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
About what?
Lyssa ...
Will your power outward.
I don't know how.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
The new Queen lives.
There is nothing.
You choose these?
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
<u>Why</u>?
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
We must try to get horses.
What kind of friend do you think I am?
We could reach it on fire-mares.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
We'll meet you at the inn.
I'm hungry.
I only want one.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
The leader of the Dark Ones?
Yes.
Each to his fate, lad.
Look.
Kegan!
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
We had no children.
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
No, no.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
130... 140...
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
May I go to the cinema?
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
Stop. Everyone is looking.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
I don't know... Five minutes.
You say it just to calm me!
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Yes... Twice.
He probably just went somewhere.
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
You have?
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
Ellen?
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
Well, hello.
That's me.
I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
Tom Joad?
Where am I?
What's your shoe size?
I've always wanted a watch like that.
I really want that watch.
What are my choices?
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
Orange soda?
No.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
Me neither.
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
Oh, and what did you do?
That's impressive. How did you do that?
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Please!
Thank you, Sera.
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
About ready for another drink?
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
Were you with another man?
Are we done for today?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
It's so shameful...
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Who's askin'?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Sit down.
What's going on?
Why didn't you call me?
I'm sorry?
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
Yes?
I think so...
What'd you do?
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
God, that felt great!
What's the point?  Look at me.
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Uh -- family.
I'm her sister.
Name?
I know. He has it sent out.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Power yoga?
Picking out my wedding dress!
Did she do that to you, too?
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
Oh, my God!
Someone missed you.
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
In court. On opposing sides.
More fun win battle?
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
Not from me, surely...
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
What will become of me then?
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
We be honored, friend Ogg.
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
Enough!
You be our guest, Jack.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Don't you care about what's happened?
And who might that be?
The colt's still too small.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
Track the demon to his lair.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
Wait, Jack.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Sunlight, you say?
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Will you explain what's going on?
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
You see!  You see!
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
Dolt!
These for me?
Sport, indeed.
How much longer?
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
So, he's hiding in the dark...
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
Biting you?
Pinching me!
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Not very precise directions.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
No!
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
I'm promised to another!
Be fair, Oona.
Sorry, Jack.
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
To Castle Couer de Noir?
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
I put him to work.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
You'd better call and cancel.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
Don't you have school?
What's today?
Did you feel anything?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
He jumped into the ocean.
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
Huh?
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
I don't want you to!
Not really.
Mr. Stevens?
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
A sink?
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
Maybe...?
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Is Alyssa home?
Is Alyssa here?
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
Are you totally insane?!
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
You'll have money when you work.
I can promise you complete privacy.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
I'm not even listening.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
What would you like to be?
What are you now?
Sun glasses?
After everything he did to you and your mom?
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
I aimed high.
Ah!  Oh....
How many bedrooms will your house have?
Because Dad left?
Where have you been for a week?!
Kurt's been feeding him.
But you can't call me while you think?
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
George --
Oh...with his ear infection!
You brought your kids?
Do you need help?
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
What did he say?
I better get the kids home.
Nothing.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
I'm helping George build his house.
I can't go right now.
That's the problem.
You don't look like you.
I've missed you guys.
Do you know anything about building a house?
I didn't go in your room.
Yeah.
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Queer.
What did you say?
Dad's home, already?
But you can't.
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
Yes, sir.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Don't I know you?
What are they gonna do to us?
Start your job? What kind of job?
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
That's right, a loan officer.
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
What does that mean?
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
We'll just get off at the next stop.
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
I don't know. Who do you want?
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
Him?
One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
What the hell are you doing?
Don't make me take them away from you.
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
I know you're not talking to me...
You ever done time before?
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
How about some steak sauce?
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
So it don't exist.
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
What's the Boom Boom Room?
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Blacks welcome there?
I'm interested. Keep talking.
Is this a joke?
Now will you get in the flask?
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
And give you a good buzz.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
She goes to Parson's, right?
An angel?
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
What's Nicky doing down there?
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Hey.
It's Stanley, sir.
Should we wake him up?
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
The South.
Why are you laughing?
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
"Octopus people?"
Basically, yeah.
Why would you be floating?
..."The Devil?"...
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
Off limits.
Why is that funny?
Hey...
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
How did they get in here?
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
Just the face.
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
What's wrong, Available?
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
Not about that.
What Quad do you live in?
You know.
I wish I could help you.
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
What does it mean?
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
Of course.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
All this. All of it.
For as long as I can remember.
What kind of place is this?
What makes you think so?
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
No, no, no
More... many more.
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
I don't think so.
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Listen.
They're comin' with us.
What do you mean by that?
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
You like it?
So, should I call Andy?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Alice...
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  We can go anywhere.
Andy, who is that guy?
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
What's up?
You don't look so good.
Yeah? what did they want?
Never saw him before in my life.
One of the guards must have leaked it.
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
What's bothering you, Madison?
At your house. Don't you remember?
Same one you were reading the other night?
I called, you know.
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
You like pornos?
Who is this?
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
It was weird...
Hey... Sheila.
Cable from Gainsford.
Fossils, huh?
Sorry.
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Why, of course. Yes.
Look here—
Yes!
Something tells me this means food. Come on!
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
Certainly not.
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
Yes.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
Yeah. You know.
They were in a quandary, and—
What are we going to do?
It's unbelievable.
No.
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
You have no disputes over women?
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
Who?
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
No porters here!!
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Now, what would you like to do?
Oh, immediately.
Then it's done.
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
Yes.
Bob! I think I hear motors!
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Yes.
What are these people?
What's it mean?
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
Did I say "if"?
Well - I mean—
Is that all my story meant to you?
Oh, George . . .
Maria?
Why not?
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of it, too. You saved my life. I never could have made it alone.
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
I saw a man whose life was empty.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
I'm thirty.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
What is it?
Go? Where?
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Perhaps.
Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
...touch that.
What the hell...
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
What?  Who the hell are you?
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
Looks like a train ticket.
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
So... how'd you hear about this?
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
Why not?
What is it?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
No.
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
Nothing.
We need to talk to you about the alien.
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
Actually, I don't know...
And get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  Well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Can you see the balloon man?
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
Because I found out about her...
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
Why?
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
That's not much.
It's all I could safely move.
You don't remember me, do you?
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
Victim's a white female.
... Graveyard shift.
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
I go running down there.
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
Confirm with trig and image.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
You're certain?
Yes.
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
You gonna tell on me?
Wally, listen to me...
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
Rufus, play it back...
Sean --
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
Who made you do this?
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
So you won't help me?
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
What safe place is that?
Where?
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
Sean --
You have an emergency call on your private line.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
It's the same prevision.
So there is a way to fool the system?
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
I don't have any sugar either.
No.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
You mean after he lost your son.
It was nobody's fault.
But John was with him at the pool?
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
What does he want with a precog?
Yeah.
No thank you.
We have snifters
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
I know.
Chloe?
No. What kind of bachelor party?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
I never promised you anything.
Goodbye, Bobby.
Get your hands off of her.
C'mon girl. Eat up.
How bad is it?
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
Where is this happening?
No.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
Ricky's taken care of.
You like the ponies?
Me? No. Not really.
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
Not driving Jess, you won't.
What?
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
A bad heart.
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Can you check?
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
I'll page you.
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
It's not even yours.
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
I don't know.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
Great. On my fucking room.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
You know this guy?
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
He wants to see us now.
We're not getting whacked.
Put that shit out...
Let's check out the penguins.
I'm pretty sure we do.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
What do you have left?
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
Where do you get this shit?
Hey, boys.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Yeah. I want it.
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
A little.
You look good, man.
Yes?
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
I'm half Irish.
And where is...?
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
Keys.
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
What?
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Edinburgh.
I am.
Dip?
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
I'm working on it.
Shit, what else she gonna say?
Let Billie finish.
Man, what do you want?
What did you give it to me for then?
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
What do you do with your time?
A black man playing big league ball is something.
You are now Benjamin 2X.
Is the program ready?
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
I'm in Detroit.
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
The talk is everywhere!
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
Let some of us come down there.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
What color were the original Hebrews?
Mind your own goddamn business... She comes in a lot?
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
How many you turning out?
Well, all right, then.
Fine as May wine.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
What am I doing here?
What do you want?
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
[I'm on to Juarez.]
Deal.
[Don't lie to me.]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
Who's he?
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[Please, don't...]
[Lucky how?]
[And?]
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
What are you doing here?
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
If they like me.
The United States.
Why not?
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Time will tell.
Did you like school, Creasy?
No.
No.
How do you think he got out?
They'll be back in a week.
It hurts.
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
Yes.
Well, it's a sort of wife.
I don't understand.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
Could I stop you?
You think too much?
You've done much of this work before?
No.
Rosanna Guerrero.
Last night. Do you know something?
What was her name?
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
Creasy.
[I know this. Your point?]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
He's not a cop killer.
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I could see she likes you.
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Are you kidding?
Hey! What are you doing here?
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
What happen?
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
Wadda you think?
Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life.  And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.
I'd like that very much.
You got an elevator in this house?
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
You not ugly.
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
What, Ma?
What didn't you like about her?
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
He coming home right now.
Well...
That's all right, that's all right...
On accounta...
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
Yes, O'Reilly?
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
Miss you, Walt.
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
What the hell's going on here?
I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
So long, Ho-Jon.
There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
Well, there it is. Jesus!
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
Sixteen times.
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
You betcher ass, Dad.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
Radar!
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
Look.
It's in pretty deep.
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
He only lasted one season.
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
Of course not.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
You're asking for somebody else?
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
It was really nice of you to take me along.
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
He's coming to.
But I had this feeling I ought to make the effort. To test myself. And I flunked.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Sir?
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
Nice.
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Huh?
Are you all right?
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
With all of it?
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
Oh, yuh did, huh?
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Hello?
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
What letter?
You made it up.
A deal?
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh—
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
Ba-ll!
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
No!
How could he be a fake? 
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Sure.
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
That's a lie! Listen—don't believe what he says . . .
Flowers.
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
What do you mean, too bad?
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Out the window! Something just flew by!
Is there a crowd in the street?
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
SWAT wants to go in.
No -- you can't do that.
Not that we know of.
You're my hero.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
I what?
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
That's right.
Being faxed over now.
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
Is that all?
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
You ever been in a hostage situation?
Explain how that works.
I think I can handle that one.
You know the ten commandments?
Yes.
Yes.
Why?
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
We lost.
How long you been coming here?
How many have you lost?
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
Only that floor.
I know how you feel, Ray.
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
What do you want from me?
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
You think I didn't need you?
Stay here, don't move.
Hmm?
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
Repoed this morning.
Who's running it!
Any verification on numbers.
Are these yours?
Wake up?!
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
It's not real.
But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies.
And what about the reconfiguration?
The woman you're stuck on.
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
Why?
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
You said we were on the same programming team.
I wasn't with you.
But you were with me.
Sorry?!
Don't know what you're talking about.
Resurrection.
Transmit copy of program via satellite north uplink.
Access established.
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
He's on us!!
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
Wow.  Sand.
Release the power with the power.
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!
Where did it originate?
NEW POWER COINS!!
... Not bad.
And how do we release the power?
What!
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
So Chicago's been good to ya.
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
The goddamned bastards.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Lad, I'm a busy man. July's always a big month for murder. Fella named Barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  Black Hand.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.
Who hired the bastard?
It's a mask.
Why? You're the innocent one.
I booked passage to London.
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
I'll handle the Boss.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
That's why I'm here.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Stu Miley.
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
At the moment, yes.
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
What's the "bad" part?
I might wake up.
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
I just need to use the phone, lady.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Uh-huh?
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
Well, they were right out in plain view.
Behind the books.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
What happened?
Where to?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Where's the Majority Leader?
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
But it *isn't*?
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Why do I always laugh at that?
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
Waiter!
Shut up, Diz.
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
That infernal phone!
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 
What is it?
Taylor, my dear.
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
One minute! Just one minute!
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
A pet shop?
I just can't, son--not the head and tail both!
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
Goodnight, Jeff.
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
For a *question*.
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
The man downstairs said number--
Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
Most natural thing in the world!
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
Since sixteen or so.
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
I don't see where we are *with* it.
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
Great.
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
Saunders--!
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
But--I've done everything I--
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Yay!
Sure.
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
I'm splendid, too.
How's that, buddy?
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned-- in a high fever. Smith's gone again. Have you any idea where?
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
You won't stand for it?
Jim!
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
Senator Paine will state it!
Deeds?
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
And you saw them happen?
It isn't all! I'd like to explain—
Oh, thank you!
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Feel better now?
Uh-huh.
Now, what do you see?
You said I was a lady in distress.
Oh, I don't know.
Really?
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
I've often thought about going back.
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
Let's just walk, okay?
Mary, I'm going home.
Uh-huh.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
Can I have a month's vacation?
With pay!
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
Last night he proposed to me.
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he—
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
I suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get—
Yes, sir.
Is that the best you've got?
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
Stuff, sir?
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
What for?
Will you have a cigar?
Yes. That is to say—
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
No, thanks.
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
That's funny. Why is that?
Entertainment?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Oh, they insisted on following me.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
Why, it's an artistic institution—
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Let him alone.
—my wife wanted me to tell you she—  —she prays for you every night.
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
Proceed.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married—
Christian Svenson.
South Dakota - north?
You mean—  —by the neck or something?
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
But she's on the telephone—
You try it.
Why are they ganging up against me?
How did they threaten you?
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
You can go out there if you like...
Mr. Cook.
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
I'm fine.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
But you do therapy?
What Ernest means, I think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. We're great believers in learning from each other. I've learned so much from Ern -- Dr. Delbanco...
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
What are you doing for lunch?
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
What kind of doubts?
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
Why? I'm paying for this.
No?
It's a thought I had.
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
It was Henry Follett.
How long you been in this town?
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
Don't need it.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
No, I really don't.
What would you do?
I don't know. I barely made it today.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Sorry... I'm done.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
You're doing great.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
Is that when you split up?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
Um-huh.
I'm glad.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
What?
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Things got a lot worse.
And the drugs?
Psych major?
English Lit.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
I'm here for you, Doc.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
And then killing your sister.
Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender?
Let's make us even, shall we?
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
Immune from what?
What does he want the book for?
What just happened?
The key!? She has the lost key!?
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
And what is he in prison for?
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
No.
No?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
I was mistaken.
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers!
What?
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
I knew you'd know.
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
He was cute though.
Sounds good to me.
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Have you considered my offer?
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
I got it.
Just a waitress.
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
Who's the artist?
Come here.
Then why are you here?
What?
Who?
Hi.
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
Me, too.
What are you talking about?
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
This place is built like a fortress.
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
Why not?
Nah.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Are you famous?
Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
But... the silverware?
Don't crunch the leaves.
Do we have to?
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
I think it's absolutely charming.
Please...
Things are quite serious, I should say.
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
Any cannon?
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
Thank you, sir.
My God...!  What time is it?
Why didn't you wake me then?
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
That is correct.
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
Oh...?
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
Will you use the troops?
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
No.
Who is it?
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
Yes, I wrote it.
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Do you know the joke about the two Swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time?
Yes, sir.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Yeah.
It's cool, but where's the water?
What's the green stuff poking out?
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
It's about to work, just come on.
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
Why?
How can they do this?
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Yeah, air.
Naw, you go first.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
What is it?
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.
It's alright.
You too.
Smokin' what?
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
Craig, this Roach.  Roach, this is my cousin, Craig.
Are they still out there?
Today ain't my day.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
'Take your car?'
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
Mr. Nasty time?
That's my girl.
Uh, yes..
'S okay. What do you think?
Huh?
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
My security people are right next door.
That's...a comfort to hear.
I remember you...in the elevator.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
Can we go now?
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
Could I see some identification, sir?
What's your point?
I will do no such thing.
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
I killed you.
I kill her - and you kill me.
I want'to talk to her.
Is that something precious?
On TV.
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
No...kisses to you.
I'm just an accountant.
You're going to go see her.
I don't know.
What are you going to do!?
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
And what happens if I don't call you?
Yeah.
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.
Uncle Birdie!
She went.
You have all sinned!
Plan on a longer visit next time.
How do you mean?
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
About what!
Walt!
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Bluebeard!
Tricked us!
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
My, that fudge smells yummy!
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
John! Don't!
Please be quiet -- Oh please, Pearl!
Huh?
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
What secret shall I tell?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
The first night?
Harry!
Answer me!
My flesh and blood!
What's wrong, John?
Them kids!
What are you after them for?
He never asked me for nothin'.
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
Oh my god, oh my god...
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
Because he was scary, that's why.
Yeah. So?
Who?
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
Rod's not a lunatic.
Decide to take a day off after all?
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
Nan, I --
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Who? Who did that?
How you know that?
School.
Get into bed.
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
Great
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
Feeling better?
Someone else was there.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Rod says the sweetest things.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
Evening gown?
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
You feel it, though.
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
And they might believe her in Moscow.
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
Monsieur.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
We can wait.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
We don't want to be disturbed.
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
We did it with the best intentions...
If there is anything we can do for you...
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
What can I do about it?
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
What business?
Confess what?
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
But you had!
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
Oh no. No visa.
What?
Thank you.
Why do you need my finger?
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
Yes, it is.
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
I will start with you.
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
The bayonet? Did you really?
It's false sentimentality.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
On which boat?
Do you like Scotch stories?
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
Yes.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
No... go on.
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Go on.
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
No speech.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
...and we won't clench our fist...
Our salute will be a kiss.
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
What shall we get? The news!
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Oh, yes.
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
You haven't seen her yet?
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Yes, Swana.
No thanks, Swana.
All right, I'll listen.
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Has done what?
Good morning.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
We have nothing to discuss.
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
You leave me no choice.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Thank you.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
Raw carrots and beets.
Where is that?
It's just a place for workmen.
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
You do it.
It's a code or something.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
That's what they're doing.
June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
So?
I did?
Well, why not?
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
Silence!
"National security priority restricted and controlled secret."
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
Money.  Follow the money.
We really must go, Mr. President.
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
More light, chief?
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
I can't ...
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
And me? ...
Yes.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
Oh, my goodness ...
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
Kissinger?
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
What do you mean, Jack?
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
Did you cry when he died?
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
That'll be the day.
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
Bernstein.
Proud?
Of them.
I'll concede in the morning.
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
Yeah ... I'm out.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
Anything.
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
Congratulations, Dick.
You.  What' you're doing --
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Some say you are, Rocky.
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
How's that?
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
I am older.
...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway.  Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
No ID in her room?
No money in his room there?
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Try "old" on for size.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
Nothin'?
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Who's he in trouble with then?
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
It could be.
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.
That's possible.
So when was he here?
...Now that's aggravating.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
...How'd you sleep?
It ain't even three years we been married.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
Just keep it up.
Llewelyn.
Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Promise?
What should I do?
Where does he work?
Is Llewelyn there?
How'd you find it?
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
Why would I care where you're going.
...I know where you are.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
Y'all getting any rain up your way?
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
You live in that house behind the store?
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Call it.
No.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
The kind with the most poles.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
Okay.
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
Okay. We can stop that.
Could I get another room.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
It's called a transponder.
I don't know. American citizens.
No sir.
Don't jack with me.
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
Jesus...
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
Well, do something, then, damnit!
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
...I don't think I know that hospital.
Did you watch it yet?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
So, call me when you --
Sure you don't want any salad?
...well, then you ain't got much.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Looking for someone?
Your husband?!
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
Hell of a way to die.
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
It's not here. Let's go.
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Like... us?
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
Where? Where is she?
Wesley...
It just didn't fit her profile...
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
Hey... Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy?
Did Chloe crack?
You lie, motherfucker...
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
You can't do this -
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Izzat right?
Yeah, look at me.
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
...I'm not sure that's Pete.
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Pullin' ah pants down...
- in the gods - Huh?
That's not my ring.
Pete... I do apologize.
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
Daddy!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
That's a maiden name.
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Great ass.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
I'm doing okay, sir.
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
I want to fly, sir!
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
Yes, sir!
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
He was. He died.
Yeah.
You're sure it's okay?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
How did it go with you guys?
He ask you out for next weekend?
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
What did you tell him about the baby?
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
You stayed after all.
You're better than candy.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
Does it still hurt?
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
Remember that.
Are you okay?
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
Pure idiot.
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
Everything okay?
Can we come in?
Oh, I've seen these...
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
That's highly inappropriate.
No cars.  Feet are faster.
Something's weird.
Well, I know that now.
Fuck him.
What?!
Are you freaking out?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
What, what, what is it?!
Blue is phones?
He'll do something.
Where is the Glucogen?
Tyrone...
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
...The police report says he was shot three times but the coroner's report says quite clearly that Denzil Dowell was shot six times. And two of those shots were in his armpits. Brothers and Sisters you know why that is?  Because Denzil had his hands up!!
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
Hey... what the hell you doing?
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
You know it. Stay Black...
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
That's right brother... listen and learn.
So talk...
Wait a second there brother...
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
I don't know about that.
What's the pig's name?
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
Huh?
You got something on your mind... "brother."
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
You couldn't have known.
Of course, I do.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
Their names, ranks and posts?
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
The middle colonies?
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
And, Corporal...  ... be careful.
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
I don't care.  I hate him.
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
Bite?
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
You need a glass?
Not at all.
God, that's fine.
Allman Brothers.
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Does she love the cat?
What say, Louis?
It's funny, all right.
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
Why, then, things should be fine.
Rachel not feeling well?
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
She.  Goes.  Free.
Elizabeth goes free!
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
Why don't I want to do this?
The situation has changed.
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Can I trust you?
Boy overboard!
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
Ceremony?
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
But ... you did it before!  Last time --
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
That was before I met one, of course.
What are you doing?  You've burned our food, the shade -- the rum!
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
Dead serious.
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
Who makes all these?
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Where does it make berth?
Because you're a pirate.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Agreed.
Not without my effects.
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
No, it's not.
He's not telling the truth.
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
Icky!  What's happening?
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Did you feel that?
The fact is, that the milk has been spilled and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.
Facts, Dr. Nebbleman.  Facts. You've been using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven't you?
They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.
Hey!
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
What are you going to do?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Like Crazy Glue?
Same old Daniel.
I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell.  I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly.  Exciting stuff.  I got to tell you, it really kept me going.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
Why do we need it?
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
Just look at it!
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
What's that?
That's going to fit me?
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
Susie... I...
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
We were different people then.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you.
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
I could have you fired right now.
What in the hell?
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Don't mind Mother.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you—
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Do you like them?
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
Gallagher!
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
I see.
Stewart!
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
That's an excellent idea.
What is this person doing here?
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
This way.
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
Yeah?
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
With me you can always do business.
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
—Mr. Schuyler .
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
What play?
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
I beg your pardon, sir?
That's a lovely dress.
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
Sure - I think so, Stew.
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
It'll be ready in a minute.
Yes.
Okay - you remember Joe—
I'm sorry nobody could come.
Are the cars ready?
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousand—and you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
With pleasure, Madame!
Well done, sir. Very neat.
Me, sir?
No, sir.
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
Mary Sue?
No. I want to know.
Does it look okay?
Where'd you get this?
No she's not.
Wait ...
Sure you are.
Really Biff? The keenest?
I'm busy.
Don't! Just let go.
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
No. Of course not.
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
What color is that hedge of yours?
What are you doing?
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
I don't believe this.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
What were you doing in a library?
They don't notice that kind of thing.
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
What did you do to him?
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
What the hell's going on!
Because we don't belong!
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
What?
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
Bud?
What?
Have you cooked the burgers?
Yes.
Hi.
I'll never be able to do that.
Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years.
Free?
That's it.
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
I'm trying to be your friend.
I know.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
What's all this pudding?
You're so scared.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
I'm just laying on my bed.
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Really?
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Where is she?
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
Hello?
Not very late.
Me?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
I need help.
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
Not very well.
There's a piano in the street.
Yeah.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
What do you do with all this pudding?
Really?
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
This is funny.
....Hi.....
Who is it?
About six months.
Yeah, no, I see --
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Yes? I'm trying.
You don't think you'll go --
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
I'll see you later.
Ok.
What do you mean?
I don't freak out.
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
I'm fine are you ok?
For what?
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
Well who did?
I don't know.
Yes it is.
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
It's ok, take your time.
Can you say that my name is Jack?
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
Who is this?
Mhm.
It's alright.
Hey...Lance....can I.....
Yes I'm fine.
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
Hi.
I need to talk to you for a second.
Yes I am.
What are you doing?
I know.
I'll see you there.
Your expenses are your own.
That's it.
Nothing.
You ready?
Are you ready?
Should I call you later?
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
Marquis? Is that you?
Has he hurt you?
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
His rug.
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
Coulmier, you animal!
-- that was lust --
Why was it you never took her by force?
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
His wife's?
You have to believe me, I had no idea --
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
As for the author... shoot him.
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
There's something else I want from you.
Is it awfully violent?
Most assuredly.
Is it terribly erotic?
They've taken your clothes?
Surely you've seen a man naked.
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
But it's just begun --
You're just scared.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
Randolph!
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
This picture--
There's nothing to explain
I wanted it
I don't want you to--
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
Sir?
I can't remember the lines!
No -- no -- I mean--
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
What are movies about?
Like a bug.
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
I don't wanna write about no spic.
The old man has his own way of doing things
Oh for Christ's sake-
Oh Christ...
Yes.
Please don't say this.
Mank-
It doesn't have to be
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
It's 350 pages long.
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
So they're Jews. . .
What does this have to do with--?
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Mank!
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
Oh God.
Well, this is a great pleasure. Miss Davies! I just saw that ENCHANTMENT is playing at a the Tivoli, the revival house in Santa Monica. That was a fine picture!
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
It came.
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
I think you better sit down
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
We're from...
All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
How can he embarrass you?
Believe what you want.
This looks done.
It's not done.
Where you going at this hour?
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
Harder.  Take the towel off.
Answer me when I talk to you.
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
Yeah --
How do you know? You know her that good?
Yeah, she's nice.
You know, like bang her or anything?
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
Stick out your hands, Jake.
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
How's that?
Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
When?
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
But you said "you."
Whatsa matter with you?
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
You sound bitter.
I just wanted to say hello.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
Now take the rest off.
Nobody. I love you, remember?
You did?
I dunno.
I'm leaving you Jake.
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
Excuse me for living.
This is Doyle's house.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
But his leg!
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
You think he's getting out of here?
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
That depends on who "they" were.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
I'm not ready for marriage.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
She's only perfect.
I was.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
Police?
What?
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Anything else bothering you?
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
I have one now.
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
What is it you're looking for?
There's nothing to see.
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
Do you like it?
But you're not?
A new disease.
I thought only punks fought with knives.
Buzz Gundersen.
I think I should go home.
Tell him why we moved here.
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
Yeah!  Shh!
Hey--I want to ask you something.
Shoot, Jimbo.
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
Will you let him tell it!
Except yourself!
He depended on me.
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
Yes, sir.
What?
Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.
You scared?
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
Who's that!
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
Who?
No.  At dawn.
My gun?
Just a guard.
Good Lord!
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Things pretty tough for you at home?
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
If he could--
Bully for you.
Now that's true!
Yeah--why--
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Well--we're newlyweds.
I don't know.
Hi.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
After he tried to shoot you?
Yes.  My best friend.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Hi, Plato!
What makes you think he hates you, Judy?
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
She's being called for.
Why?
Gabriel -- !
Must have a way with stationery.
Read a lot about you, Nick.
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
No, hey, I like your coat --
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
No, Nick, no --
Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
He working for them on this one?
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
What?
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
They all are. Football's on.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
I'm glad it was me.
You... you don't know me --
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
What?
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
A station wagon in Canada.
I don't know.
Christmas... Eve...
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
No.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
Where is he?! Where is he?!
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
What about the money?
Monsters in the gelatin...
It's a roach, guy --
Hell you haven't.
Yeah.
Oh.
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
Tell her... I'll be there ...
That's what it looks like!
Alone at last.
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Where was she from, Compton?
We can work this out, can't we?
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
Did the two of you talk?
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
It's a change.
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
Why am I Mr. Pink?
Mr. Blue's dead?
What's she doin' now?
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
Nope.
That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
Down to my car.
Why?
For what, the cops?
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
C'mon, throw in a buck.
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.
Uh-uh, just cops.
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
He ain't dead.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
And one of 'em is sick.
Anybody hurt?
You can't leave us here.
And this is Helen Carter.
But you eat, don't you?
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
I suppose it is.
Thanks.
Will she be dark or fair?
It's going to Sonora.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
Is that the only reason you came back?
You'll live.
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
Yeah, how did you know?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
Yes, people make me restless.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
We might as well start a fire.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
I sure would.
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
You sure?
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
Can you feel that?
Oh.
Let her go, Cin.
I'm Cindy.
Noooo!!!
Oh.
Am I cool now?
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
That was a great idea, Shorty.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Professor, I think you should see this.
What is it, Dwight?
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
It's okay. I understand.
No thanks.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
What a bitch!
MURDERED?!!
Oh Mom...
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
That's right.
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
Who is this?
MOTHERFUCKER!!
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
No, I don't.
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
State your name, please.
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
And who may I ask is Carl?
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
It's him!
Beverly, are you alright?
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Sure I do.
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
Which room is it?
You could go and open the door.
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
Hello, Frances.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
"The Dante?"
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -— I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her —— to see her —— to touch her —— in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
What's that?
Let her know what?
I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
But you're always at the library.
It's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
And Gregory -- he loves her.
I understand.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
What was she to you?
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
Dr. Judd?
I'd hardly describe It that way —- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
Is it about Jacqueline?
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
Yes —— yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
But she was here?
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Graham is an unusual name.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
I feel like they do.
What?
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
Videotapes.
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
Why not?
Don't you want to make one?
I have money.
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
And now you can?
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
You're really never going to make love again?
I don't know.
Come on!!
Why are you ashamed?
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
I want to touch you.
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
You've made your point.
Isn't therapy helping at all?
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
Do you want to leave therapy?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
Why?
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
What?
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
What's wrong with that?
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
Because I never got around to it.
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
Why did you do that?
In front of him, Ann, yes.
Why?
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
I don't want to discuss it.
No, I touched me.
You want me to leave?
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
How did you find me?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
Whichever you prefer.
Yes.
Do you think I'm pretty?
No.
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
Cynthia, I don't know.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
I've got to get back to the office.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
I'm intrigued.
Hello.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
What do you mean?
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Everybody has a past.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
I like having the car, the car is important.
Where are the tapes, Graham?
Hi.
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Didn't seem worried about them.
I don't get it.
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
I don't get it.
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
I got it!  I got it!!!
I know, I know, it's just...
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
That's us.
I don't want to get up there.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
AN' YOU'RE A WEEPER AND A WAILER ALWAYS TREADING THE TOES OF THE GREAT GENERALLY SPREADING YOUR WEIGHT YOU'RE A SPITEFUL, HATEFUL ASININE CREATURE A PUPIL WITH NO SCRUPLES WHO KNEW BETTER THAN THE TEACHER
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
YOUNG BLOOD
I'm...happy.
I want to see Brad.
Do you really think so?
Brad!
Our speciality.
This could be worse than the old series.
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
Miles.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
How's it hanging, Miles?
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Two years ago, buddy.
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
Good. How're you?
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
Highliner, please.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
And?
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
I'd rather have a knife.
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
It's not even a mile.
If that's what feels right.
Sure I know Maya.
And she likes Pinot.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
We were supposed to play golf.
Later.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Right now.
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Obsessively.
What is it?
Fucker hit into us.
Is what the money thing?
With Maya.
What's happening?
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
What exactly are we going to do?
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
Thanks.
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
That's five clicks, Jackson.
What?
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
Hrnrnrn?
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
I finished it.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Twelve months in oak.
So what gems do you have in your collection?
You got kids?
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
What's the title?
Um... yeah but it's more...
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
Sure.
Okay.
Maya.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
French or American?
There's dust in it.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
I don't want you to die.
Does it hurt?
...I will.
Curse and stuff.
Do you think it's a possibility?
Yes.
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
Chicken Teriyaki.
He was only a year and half old.
That's good enough for me.
Oh.
What's that?
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
Why not?
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
All I did was kiss a girl.
Sounds good.
Forget it.
Where's Jake?
Kate?
More than enough.
Paden sends his best.
Maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday.
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
I haven't done anything.
Women?
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
Who is he?
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
What's all this then?
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Rae, all we got is each other.
What makes you think I could?
I see you're prospering without me.
What is it you want from me?
So we understand each other?
You work here?
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
And I know what I'm talking about.
What makes you say that?
I don't want you to get hurt.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
-- It's called a projector.
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Almost right.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
There isn't one.
As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
Soon.  Soon.
She doesn't want pity.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
Is Simone back to earth yet?
Not quite.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Mom, do you miss Dad?
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
Why?
You never were together, Hal.
Why not?
I've seen them all before.
I need flesh and --
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
Your mother couldn't make it?
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
Me and Simone.  What I did.
Do I know you?
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
This is the story.
So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
Abduction?
What now, Sayer?
She looks a lot like you.
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
The only real truth is in the work.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
I forgot your name.
No.
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
Dr. Crowe.
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
How often do you see them?
When they get mad, it gets cold.
What do you want more than anything?
They're right here.
You see ghosts, Cole?
Excuse me?
Chicken blood on the crops.
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
See?
Fuck you.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
Well, there goes our record deal.
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
Harvest moonshining!
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
This is his room... isn't it?
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
It's time to make amends.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
Sorry.
Whatcha' doin'?
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
You took Bill.
What's she see in that douchebag?
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
He's a fucking Martian?!
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Yeah.
I can't hear when you're nodding.
All the rib eyes?
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
You're my princess, aren't you?
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
Who'd want to?
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
But you could get killed, right?
Having fun.
Driving, talking to me...
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Seriously?!?
See ya, Kate.
By stealing my car?
I would've come back for you.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
What kind of a guy is he?
But you'll do it?
No.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Six. Got it.
Yeah?
He's history.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
Yeah, guy?
What's your twenty?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
Then don't.
Now what?
You're coming up to the scale house.
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Breaker. Breaker.
Have any trouble getting here?
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
This is Bandit I. Over.
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
Now, you just find him, son.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
But there were more of you?
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
Really?
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
What happened?
No, what did you say on the machine?
I left him a message.
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
You're finished.
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
...Yeah, fifty-three.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
-- okay, g'head --
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
Gibarian.
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
I can trust Rheya.
Didn't you talk to Snow?
In the lab.  With her, probably.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
Why would you let her to do that?
How quickly?
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
Is there anybody else here?
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
I love her.
When did this happen?
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
What do you remember?
Is it intelligent?
Then it's God, right?
Where've you been?
Why did you say those things?
What's wrong.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
What do I have to do to stop it?
Who are you, then?
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
What does it want?
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
It's terrific Win.
Would you pick one out, please?
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
They're kind of fuzzy.
Could be, I guess.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
Yeah.
Let go!
Oh that thing in Queens.
What a memory.
Everyone's all right...?
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
What shit, honey?
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
Ellie, it was a formal party...
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Coming to bed?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
What did you do tonight?
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
How are things going, pal?
So, what are you doing tonight?
And Flash isn't?
What, want a glass?
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
You stop him?
Remember Little League?
Oh, sure.
No, no.
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
How are you doing, kid?
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
He knew.
Good morning, Liz.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
My my.
I suppose.
I'd never admit that.
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
You sure about all this?
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
I am old enough to--
The record--
Absolutely no class.
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
Need any more help?
I don't think I'll be running into him.
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
Ready?
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
Then we're all in on it?
Not you.
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
You are being rude again.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
It is.
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
To the Brick Kremlin!
Let me alone.
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
May I have this dance, Miss?
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Anybody call?
Lay off, Sefton.
We did it.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
You heard that, Sefton?
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
Nothing for Kuzawa?
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
What did you say?
What time?
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
Target their Bridge.
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
Population?
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
This is the Nexus?
Why would you want to leave?
Well, may we have a look around?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
And what would that be, sir?
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
I thought you might.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.
These blast patterns are consistent with Type III disruptors.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
Aye, sir.
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
You did great, Bones... Just great.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
I don't believe it...
Hello, sir. It's David.
David!... What went wrong?
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Underground deposit?
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
.          .. Spock's tube...
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
Did your collaborator know?
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
The Genesis planet is gone.
The word, sir?
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
May I ask why...?
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.

Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
He asked you not to grieve...
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
I ordered no interruptions.
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
That's all you have to say?
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
Uh -- what are they?
Shore leave, Admiral.
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
... taking Genesis away from us...
What order? Who's taking Genesis?
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
David --
David. Please.
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't expect anything.
They won't --
Well?
Inoperative.
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
On screen.
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
Uh oh.
... the good of the few...
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
Very well.
... No, sir. It has not.
May I speak, sir?
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Understood, sir.
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
Reliant in our section this quadrant, sir, and slowing --
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
He's very human.
Certainly...
The question is irrelevant.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
That is what I said, Doctor.
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
You're saying... It is a compliment.
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
How long?
So you were at Berkeley.
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
Memory problems, too.
Do you trust me?
Just lucky, I guess.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
All right. The truth?
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
If we keep going up, they'll catch us!
You tricked me.
Oh my God, we're too late!
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
Why not?
The hell I can't
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Aye, sir. Descending.
10 seconds, sir!
What is it?
Any luck...?
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
Two?
Scotty: Are the whale tanks secure?
I'll have to re-energize.
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
The whales...?!
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
But not you.
Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
I aspire to be more than I am.
Really.
Chase me!
For what purpose?
I have to go home now.
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
I'll order Riker to turn around.
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
Understood.
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
Why would we be involved with these people?
No children?
... I believe you...
Exactly as the simulations predicted...
There must be some good people... even in this time.
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
You think they're still up there?
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
How long has he been unconscious?
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
No. I will not betray my friends.
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Captain --
Altitude fifty kilometers...
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
Captain, the Enterprise!
I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
ATR setting...
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...?
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
Return to our own time?
Unless you'd like to stay.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
We have to stop them from sending that message.
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
Admiral Donald...Bill...
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Can you - ?
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
If they're even looking for us...
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
They'll make it look like an accident...
Would you care to go topside?
You feign ignorance?
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Torpedo room--?
But if she's cloaked...
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
Kill him! He's the one!!
How much time's left of your sentence?
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
They're dying.
Never been this close.
We HAVEN'T fired -
What peace conference?
What's she waiting for?
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Channel open, Captain.
WE SURRENDER.
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
How did you - ?
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
And if they're still in place?
Can you remember our father?
Why?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
No. I must deactivate you.
Is he very much like you were?
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
So... To happy endings.
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
A bit less florid, Data.
Yes, sir.
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
Ready, Captain.
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
Yes.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
Captain, we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
Well, he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. I’d say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
It's you.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
This isn't real.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
Sir?
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
Aye, sir.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
To find the head, sir?
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
Anything.
And you're not as we imagined you.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
You don't trust me.
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
Not so long.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
No -- this is wasting time.
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
How long until we reach the Rift?
How many Warbirds will you need?
Praetor.
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
Thank you.
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Eh... yes.
We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
It's in a green Mustang?
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
Please...
Ah... no...
Steering wheel...
Gear shift.
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
Gas.
My... husband.
What?
I want to try it.
What's the matter?
Why are you going here? What is here?
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
No.
Yes.
Eh... yes...
I do not speak English.
You want this ticket?
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Yes?
Goodbye.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
I will go. But not you.
Good morning.
Horses.
Yes, they are.
How long will it take you to get home?
Well...
You sure this is your car?
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
Faith, call me, okay?
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Damn right.
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
What kind of things exactly?
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
Naw.  She won't call me.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
What stuff?
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
So there never was a death squad.
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
About what?
Strickland.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Those two guys were cops.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
Who's Strickland?
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
Are we under arrest?
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
Who knows.
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Whole country or just hereabouts?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
My God.
He was sitting here?
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
He said it was a clue?
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
Who?
He got away. I had him. He got away.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
I was visiting an old college friend.
I didn't use Low's name.
I understand.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
How long have you been downtown?
Not especially.
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
"Gone live?"
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
He thinks he looks young.
What's this country coming to?
I know.
Jesus.
Sue Ann Hanson.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Hello?
Does one exist?
I'd be real careful if I were you.
Tom, you okay?
All the same killer?
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
Agent...
How did you know Speck was a killer?
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
Yeah.
[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
[You tell me.]
Yes, sir.
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
No.
I don't...
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message.
Shit.
I don't know about that.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
How are you ladies doing this evening?
...maybe...
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
I'm Mike.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Like what?
Anything.
No.
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
Always...
The poor thing. Six years?
Well, who represents you back east?
It's not going to well?
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
...The red piece of shit over there...
Hi, Mike?
Are you on the other line?
I can call back...
Why didn't you call?
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
I mean, I need the money.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
You want to hit the town tonight?
Ah, there's the rub...
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
Oh boy.
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
What are they doing here?
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
Don't call me ever again.
Hello?
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
You gotta do it.
Yea, how much?
You think so?
...So give me the fuckin part...
I gotta use the phone.
Christy was nice...
Don't remind me.
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
What time's this party tonight?
...the Copa, in New York...
What?
We got the digits, baby.
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
You think?
...double diamond...
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...honestly...
Be smart about it.
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help.  I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.
No.  You ask for too much.
What's the matter, Carlo?
You heard about your father?
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
You take care of Paulie?
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
Should I bring him in.
When does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
No.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
Barzini will move against you first.
Godfather, you understand everything.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
I know.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
It's the real Thunderbolt, then.
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't seem worried about Luca.  That worries me.
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
What about McCluskey?
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
Michael.
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Can you say it?
Will you?
You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
What is it?
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
Thanks.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
You just woke up!
Shut up.
What? What's this?
I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
Good afternoon!
No!
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
How?
I love Marge.
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
What are you doing?
Dickie?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
I'm well, thank you.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
I hope she never knows.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
I never said that!
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
So I'm learning.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Dickie did it.
Very.
It's all true.
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
So you found Peter...
Where's Dickie's father?
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
What's your secret?
I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Hello Meredith.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
So -- are you travelling under R?
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
I've been backpacking.
Not guilty.
It's okay.
Tom, are you okay?
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
Well that would be even better gossip.
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
Even her.
I have!
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
Nah, this'll be fine.
Huh?
Really?
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
The DMZ?
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
You must be rich.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
Huh?
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
No, why?
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Stick up?
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
I have.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Do you understand why I came here?
Well, I tried.
Well, you want to or not?
Huh?
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
Cops don't do nothin.
How?
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
Age?
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Shit.
O.K., cowboy.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Real down.
Like do anything, you know.
Could we change the subject?
Spit it out.
During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
I'm not a fool, Billy.
Hi.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
I think  it's worse  now.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
City hall?
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
And why not?
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
I do.
I... I need a drink of water.
Yes.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
Thanks.
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
Ernie.
Yes.
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
I... no, I... I just can't...
She's very pretty.
Evening, Luke.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
You can't testify.
"Ashes To Ashes?"
Luke didn't smoke.
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
No, I...
Please, sit.
What exactly did you hear?
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
I think so.
I suspected as much.
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
I don't understand.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
And the second?
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
Is smoking fun?
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
I don't know, honey.
Good morning.
Do you know him?
Yep.
Yes, but where?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
I wonder if you could tell me...
The little girl's name.
The little Brenner girl?
Yes.
Yes?
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
You did say birds?
I know, Mother.
Yes, Mother.
Tell him about the party.
When?
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
Mitch...
If they are?
What?
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
Would you like me to go for her?
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
Doesn't what make me...?
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss...
We met in court.
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
I think you're a louse.
What made it...
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
We... we went to school together. College.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Why did he shoot her?
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
I'd still like to see you.
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
It's an uprising.
Of birds?
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
Well, they'll go along with anything.
It was like that yesterday.
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
How long have they been gathering there?
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Santa Rosa?
Mitch...
That... that... who was that?
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
Yes, certainly. 
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
Scotch, light on the water.
There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
I want you to help my little girl.
It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
But you did promise.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
I can't believe that.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
I want it --
Don't you want to find the white horse, Georgina?  You can't find him from a wheelchair.  You have to walk and run to find him.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
I've ordered nothing from you.
This is a gift you'll not return.
I've drunk enough tonight.
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
You and I should work together.
Burke them?
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
Was the paralysis immediate?
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
She would if she could.
Crony indeed!
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
Two down. Two to go.
You think I'm crazy.
You lied at my trial.
I don't know you, man.
Wrong. Answer.
Fucking Zombie.
The scar. Which of you has it?
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
I do. Every day.
But you, you've had them.
It still doesn't mean...
You killed her!
Sweetheart...
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
You wrote this?
Yes -- that is true.
That can easily be arranged.
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
But how -- how long--?
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
Is it worth anything?
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
All day.
Burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>!
Maximum body-count.
That's right.
Where you going?
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
Oh, no...
David.
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
Sure.
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
I thought we were poor.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Are you following me?
Star.
I guess you're new around here.
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
It's gone.  I feel it!
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
And I don't want any more food with sedatives in it.  I know what you're up to.  Don't think I don't.  And if anyone tries to get in here -- I've got rope.  I'll hang myself before it gets to me.
Too damn dangerous.
I don't know who to trust.
Let go of me...
Let's open it.  Now...
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
Where's the other half?
But...
What for?
We should have jumped his ass.
Maybe we shouldn't.
My God, what in hell happened here?
Well, who's got access to it?
And if anyone tries to wake me...
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
How far's that?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
How many in their party?
You reach anybody yet?
Put that down!
No.
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
Where was he trying to go?
Get back!!
Calm down and get in your position.
You jerking off or just pissed?
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
Ah... no.
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
What else can they do?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
How did you know?!
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
But you escaped.
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
We need your help.
Excuse me?
Send him away.
So, do we go on?
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
It's what they want you to see.
Yes.
This has to end.
You took her because she helped me.
A man can change his history.
And why not?
May I help you?
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
Why is it -- breaking up?
You're late.
Got here as soon as I could.
Holding you... again.
Alex, what is it?
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
Oh?
I'm sorry, David.
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
You wouldn't believe me.
All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
How long ago?
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
Or mud carriers.
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Is it?
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
Mara --
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
What are your people called?
They've gone to a better place.
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
No, you're safe --
Should we be...
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
Relax.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
And what's that?
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
And what does that mean?
My father used to talk about you.
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
No, it hasn't.
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
You're just gonna walk?
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
I know.
How long do we have?
I don't know.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
You're sure?
Good. How's your mom?
And if I didn't want to come?
You were convicted of the crime.
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
[Beat] How do you know?
Becker does? Are you sure?
I'm not sure.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Why "of course"?
[Beat] I was dropped off.
This is pretty good. Considering...
Well, good for you.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that.
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
I am the great and powerful Oz...
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
What?
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
I always knew that.
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
Christ, sure... yes!
Can't it go to any office?
Is that how you answer the phone?
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Who is it?
Maybe.
Will you at least see how it fits?
In the back?
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
Louise.  Where are we going?
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
He's got a lot to be proud of.
So what are you gonna tell him?
What happened to your hair?
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
You think you've found your calling?
You're disturbed.
Yeah.
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
It won't work.
Louise?  Where are we?
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
What?!
Harlan.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
Thelma, that is not an option.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
It'd have to be pretty good.
What?!
What?!  What d'you think?!
What?!
What?  What are you talkin' about?
Are you going to apologize or not?
So you admit it?
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
Well why don't you look her up?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
Hey, look on the bright side --
Uh-huh.
And this adversely affects me how...?
Check.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
Huh.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Who?
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
Healy you dog!
Very nice.
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
I work with retards.
That sounds like fun.
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
Urrggghh...
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
All you want is a phone number?
So she's married?
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
Oh. Well I am.
I can live with those reflections.
It means you're too hard on guys.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Pat does projects all over the world.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
No, it's an old football injury.
Oh, are you on the team?
Really? I never got a message.
Hey.
Hi, Ted.
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Get out.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Ted...?
Well, there's only one thing to do.
What are you doing?
Starshells.
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
Smoke.
What's it about?
The sun came up today.
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
This is from the Highest Authority?
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
I want an hour with him.
Hey, sport. You winning?
I don't care. Cancel it.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Hey. Nice tie.
Yeah.
You're my hero, Carl.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
What are you doing?
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
-- did you understand me when I said that --
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
Couldn't sleep.
How'd you know?
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
Thanks, Cooch.
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
What's he smoke in that?
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
I don't see the connection.
That's not solid.
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
What the hell do you want me to do?!
He's gone.
That's it. The Stronghold. Get us in there, we got a chance.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
No plates. No registration. Serial numbers removed. And all prints washed off by the river. That's great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?
I read, Cooch.
Good.
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
That's a big comfort to me.
Yeah, most likely.
That's all!
Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something.  I'm sorry.
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Uh hum.
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
It dies. We live.
You don't have to kill it.
Doesn't it ever bother you?
Where are we?
Do what, show you a good time?
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
How do you play reality.
True.
Take something off.
What does it mean?
I know exactly what you mean.
Can't shake him.
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
This is crazy!
What are you doing?
Not anymore.
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
Is there something I should know?
Is it the plane?
You're not supposed to...
What do I want?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
Who's your pilot?
What was that?
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
We did it!
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
What what are you doing? We're cover!
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
They should have warned you about that one.
Skipper, you can't do this!
What now?
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
Three guesses.
It was bad.
You didn't help.
Was going.  Now you are.
How do you feel?
I'm nothing like him.
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
Why not?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
I am Quaid.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
Two-headed monsters?
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
I want that fucker dead.
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Would you please repeat the destination?
Mmmm.....
The brunette.  The one you told me about.
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
Lori, move.
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
And falling in love?
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
I'm not interested in that.
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
Don't be ridiculous.
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
The one in the mine!
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
She's got my vote.
Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
Well, we can take my truck then.
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
You're really leaving, huh?
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
This is one big mother!
We'll take your word for it.
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
I think the ground's getting closer.  I think we do it.  We're gonna save our asses here!
From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it?
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
That-a-boy. Hospital.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
It most certainly is.
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !
Let's snuff this lowlife!
I can describe it.
We had a description of the suspect.
Of course.
It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
So go take your job on Wall Street.
Ten years is a long time.
You really think that's what happened?
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
-- Yeah?
A fucking wheelchair?
-- What?
Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
-- What?
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
...For ten years, now.
I embellished.
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
Racist asshole came at me.
I killed the motherfucker.
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
See-cil.
...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?
-- alleged crime --
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
I followed you here from court.
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
Tell me some other things about her.
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
What?
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
Someone else has it now.
Any friends?
What happened to her?
Sort of shorthand.
Lil was wearing a sour face.
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
Agent Desmond, it's...
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Maybe.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Goodbye, Muffin.
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
Nice night.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
I am The Muffin.
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
What's going on?
What do you mean?
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
Hiking?
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
Leland...
Did you get this from your lover?
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Bobby didn't give you this?
Who am I?
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
There's no one here.
Yes.
Four cases in three years...
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
We thought it was just.
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
Yes.
Yes.
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
Meth... Methodology and Technique...
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Well, we...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
That's what I'd planned to...
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
And you wrote that...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
Thank you...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Who told you that?
Yes.
A single hour.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
...things change.
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I need an extension for my case.
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Are you done?
D'you find an apartment?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Maybe what?
What...?
And it's over...?
Not if you don't grow up...
If I don't 'grow up...'
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
You're pressuring yourself...
Mr. Alito, please.
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Missus...
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
You know what happened.
Nothing happened.
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
...I understand...
We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
...he's a good man...
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
Been a long time, huh...?
Oh shit, what's today?
Today is Tuesday. What?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
...one of the other nurses?
...four years ago...
Yes, that's correct.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Yes.
Yes, the roving nurse...
Huh. And why is that?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Me, too.
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
Hey, there - open up!
There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
Is that it over there?
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
What's he like?
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
We will, sir!
They don't do much of anything...!
They are living creatures out there.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
Come on.  Kids love horror.
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Like what?
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
These look quite fresh.
This is going to give you nightmares.
He's on his way.
Dylan, where's the man?
Heather?  You doing okay?
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
Really?
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
Fred Krueger did it.
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Why did we begin this?
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
Come in.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
Fifteen.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
Where you going?
You're not a moron.
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
Believe what?
You okay?
I just can't believe it.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Figured what out?
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
I thought this was your dream come true.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
Sorry to here it.
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
Yes.
How do you know?  They might.
Who told you that?
It works?
Northeast sir!
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
Trust me donut.  I know.
They tell you that?
Joy, rapture...
I can't be sure.
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
It wasn't hard.
... Absolutely not.
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
Y'all take American Express?
Well... Yeah - okay.
You black?
No.
You an indian?
Have now.
What's she doin' here?
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
No sir...
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
You ain't actin', mama.
And?
I'm scared, mama.
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
Hell, peanut...
So?
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
Come look at this.
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
Oh shit...
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
Oughta make 'em happy.
Let's leave here.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
What?
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
I'll bet.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
Got any plans?
Have it your way... But you want it.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
No.
Through the forehead?
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
Santos... What's happenin' here?
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
Thank you.
Trip??
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
What's this guy's problem?
Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I --
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones.
So whose car is it?
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
No. But I don't think that matters.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
It's mine.
And your wife left you.
She told you about...
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
Really? That's remarkable.
So what are you doing out here?
Is that really it?
Go ahead.
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
There is, but it's not that interesting.
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Maybe...
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
What kind of dancer?
Kinship.
Someone jumped on your car with their butt...
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
Jealous? Of me?
The hell I am.
Want a bite?
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
Get out of here.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
Thanks for that. He all right?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
I got the message you called.
She's left before...
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Who's gun is that?
Pow.
You heard? How?
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
Who's that sitting in your car?
Oh?
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
James is... I don't know...
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
This is important.
No.
Is it good?
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
A jockey? You mean, like --
Hardapple?
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
There's so many...
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
You doing okay?
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
How is she?
What are you doing?
Huh?
What party?
What's that?
Next week? The week after?
It's not what you think.
I'm not a monster.
What are you looking at?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Do you believe in them?
I could take you downtown.
He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well.
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
Are you taking your medication?
No you're not.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
What will happen if I do?
It's getting dark. Go home.
And how's your job?
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
I'm still thinking about it.
How do you feel about that?
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
I suppose it's however society defines it.
I don't.
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
You don't know!
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
You're very late.
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
Where is she? What is she doing? How old --
In my bedroom, sleeping.
All right.
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
Did you get an erection?
I was six years old!
Time.
Most women wouldn't choose it.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
Neither do you.
You never spoke to me before.
What?
Doesn't it get noisy?
What?
Do you?
Maybe later.
Did I say something wrong?
What?
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
Their power. They seduce me.
Most people say the odds are against me.
I'm not scared.
It's a bad idea.
I've got problems.
I didn't sleep well.
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
You wanna know what I think?
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
No.
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
How?
Virgil?
Do we just leave him there?
Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
Are we talkin' little space friend here?
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
Getting a reading?
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
8500 feet, Bud.  Everything okay?
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?
But how could you say such a thing?
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
At what?
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
Claudia, let's get married?
What! Get married?
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
What are you saying?
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
I'm too sleepy.
I love you.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
It's divine!
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
Ettore...
And where do you find the models?
Don't you ever paint men?
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
No. The owners are in Australia.
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Is that possible?
He talked to you Himself?
No.
Yes.
Why?
It's a sin to be fat.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
You have a lovely voice.
Have you ever loved anyone?
I love you.
Did it hurt?
Yes.
I went to my room.
And then what?
From their heads...
I... I don't understand.
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Would you like to ask them?
What do you mean?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
No.
No questions.
Do you know a Marie?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
Why not?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
What?
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
I'm afraid.
Yes.
We went to chapel for vespers.
A wastepaper basket.
And the passage to the barn?
Yes.
How did she know about him?
Stay away from me...
I hate him for what he did to me.
Yes.
For what he made me go through.
It was dead.
Look into the convent records.
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
No!
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
How do you survive?
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
No-one.
Yes.
Who was the father?
I haven't a clue.
What man had access to her?
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
So, someone else could have done it.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
Nuns... you hate nuns.
It's my affair too.
Then help her.
Earthquakes?
What sheets?
You just said...
It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said?  She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
Would you like one?  Huh?
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Do you want to become one?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
My God, you're as crazy as...
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
She is an innocent.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Somebody told her.
Was it you?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
She didn't want any help.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
You tied the cord around its neck.
Oh, don't do this!
We'd be thrown out.
Oh don't be so stroppy!
Yeah, I've blown school out.
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
What about all these letters?
Well, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
I don't care.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Did you look in here?
Oh, there you are!
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
I don't think that bit's right.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Well, what happened?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Why selfish?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
Well ... what's the matter with that?
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Lip reading.
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
What's he on about?
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Why do you always use your left hand?
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
What are you doing there?
How d'you reckon that one out?
Y'what?
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
And my nose...
Y'what?
Don't exaggerate.
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Eh, what's all this?
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Locked.
Engines off.
Where the hell are we?
Gravity?
Activate lifter quads.
Then take her down.
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
What is it?
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
Maybe we can get in by the top.
Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
Wretched.  What happened to me?
I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
A transmission?
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
Yeah!
What?
Dead.
And when will you be ready to do that?
Hey, guess what?
Right. 
It makes me sick to see him like that.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
Blow the ship up?
Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
It's close, real close.
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
Oh my God.
What the hell happened?
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
But?
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
Would somebody fill me in?
Food-storage room!
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Let's hear it.
No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
What is it?
Better?
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
Are you alright?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
Where're they headed?
Listen to what?
Yeah?
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
Whoa, wait a minute...
Forget it, man.
Hold it, hold it...
What's wrong?
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Already working on it.
Compensate!
Okay, we're in business.
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
Please do.
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
You take charge.
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
What a day - what a heavenly day...
Just like it.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
All paved with diamonds and gold?
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
I'm in love with Lloyd!
I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
I never intended you to be.
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
Yes, Addison.
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
We never met. That's why.
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
Margo? Lunching in public?
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
Naturally enough, your understudy.
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Bill!
You've already met.
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
You're my girl, aren't you?
That I am...
I get a party, don't I?
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
It's a good thought.
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
That never stopped you before.
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
The audition.
Okay. Mix.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
I'm trying terribly hard.
I've been aware of that for some time.
I'll say.
I wish it were.
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
Never try to outguess Margo.
Why you have to go out there.
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
- little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be.
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
- and for you.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
You need new girdles.
And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.
Kill the people.  Got your key?
Well?
Hmm?
No.
You all put together?
He's the best.
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Try...
You're not going, are you?
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
He can help you.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
Not at all...
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Right here.
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
It's the tight girdle that does it.
You've what?
How far to the station?
Three or four miles...
What about Bill?
That's on time for Margo.
What time is it?
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
What's so funny?
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
How's the new one coming?
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Margo, you haven't got any age.
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
I don't think I could be.
Hello..
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
--mine's better--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
What's that?
Who's first?
Facts or theory?
We understand your problem--
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
--Jesus--
Hmm?
What does it say?
--what time is it?
Night.
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
I'm so glad.
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
Chapin did contact you then?
On the orders of Haldeman?
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
--no--
What's a real denial?
Where are your bills, Carl?
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
I think.
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
To cover up?
--I'm not your source on that--
How senior?
I got Clawsen on hold--
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
Where in government?
Are you sure?
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
I did all right on McCord.
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
Lotsa hints--
Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent?  And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
Does "they" mean the White House?
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
Good work, Ostreicher.
What did you just say?
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
I had no idea you'd be this good!
What do you suppose they're saying?
Why is this?
Charming.
Not bad, Chris.
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Hey, what're you doing here?
Forget it.
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
Because I want to.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
What?
You can't sing at the competition.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
I'm not playing.
Yeah right.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
...I've never tried it.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
Can I come in?
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
This'll do.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
You can do that?
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Ho-lee shit.
Kevin, this is serious!
Tonight?
That's my trick!
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
Hey...
Yeah, are you?
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Say that again, Kevin?
What?!  How do I do that?
Qualify for what?
Hey.  I got another question for you.
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Keep it down, dude.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
Ha-ha!
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
Whoa...
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
What do you mean, maniacs?
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Alright. Let me write a letter.
What've you got?
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
I shant!
Yes, your highness.
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
I cursed then all!
Hurry up with those papers.
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
You're a princess...
How is our current financial status?
What do you mean?
No. Empress, you --
What?
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
Yes.
Why not?
Allison.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Oh!
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Well, then, w-who was?
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
You-you play... very well.
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
Well, where is it? I-
For yuh.
All right.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
God bless.
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
What?
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
We can digest our-
I'm gonna have a corned beef.
Yeah.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
And blind people, crippled...
Yeah.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
You are extremely sexy.
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
U-huh.
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Were you always funny?
Well, what is your definition of following?
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
David? You call your teacher David?
M'm.
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
There's a spider in the bathroom.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
Yeah, but it's real close.
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Check it out.
Thing?
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Oh, you got a headache!
The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
Are you?
I mean that as a compliment.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
May I see your license, please?
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
I don't know, I mean, I-
You like this house, Max?
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
But she's colored.
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
Yeah.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
Oh yes.
So who won?
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
I have a small window of time.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
What?
Well, probably.
You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
So where is young Jonah?
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
Would you leave us alone right now?
He's gonna miss his flight.
He's not going tonight.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
And you're not the wife.
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
So?
Leave us alone right now.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
Oh.  You're them.
Excuse me?
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Cal, my wife Judy.
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
I call that a perfect day.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
No luck.
Happy anniversary, baby.
Accept a compliment.
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
Two minutes.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
Don't be so sure.
She left the fucking gate open.
He'll find his way back.
Love?
And how hard it hit?
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
It's a shit novel anyway.
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
You changed your mind.
Yes.
I don't want to go tonight.
Me too.
I know.
Oh, you know, I am.
Has she called?
Do I put you off?
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
I meant Sally.
I meant Sally.
Please, Ryan.
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
What?
What am I, five?
What?
I don't need a drug.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
We could hardly say no.
Come on in.
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
Thank you.
How?
Fuck you, Panes.
Like your business managers?
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
Like the last time.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
I'm worried about your Galiano.
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
Panes?
What did I do?
I hope they're watercolors!
Nevermind.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
Invisible!
So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
You're right!
You -- you think I'm right?
Wait!  When can I see you again?
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Quiet -- sshhh!!
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
Out here I'm just what?
Hlllllllp!
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
You held onto this all that time?
Z!  what are you doing?
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
Barbatus!
Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Ask me why we're so successful.
Hey, did you hear what he said?!
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
Yeah.
How is your cold?
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
You shouldn't.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter?
I don't understand --
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
Two o'clock.
Here. How about some breakfast?
Someone from the office.
In his apartment.
Your stomach?
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
I am. Let me get the cards.
I don't want it.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
For me?
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
Last night?
Where are you going, Baxter?
How would you like to go tonight?
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
I know how it is.
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
You left your wife?
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
Naturally.
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
Sure, Doc.
Where are you moving to?
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
You got a girl-friend?
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Not so rough, honey.
Good night?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
Sleeping pills.
Doctor.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
No.
What for?
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
Important?
Remember what we talked about?
I wasn't trying.
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
Lovely. You were a big help.
Where are you headed?
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Dreadful.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
I said I like all of them.
What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me.
Get out --
Who the hell are you?
Winning the war by yourself.
No.
A long time.
It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December.
Holy shit.
That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
What are you doing out here?
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Would he remember you ?
What -- happened here.
I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
What's your name, sailor ?
You smell that.  You smell that?
What?
The wind --
Wh -- what?
Haiphong.
Why did you come to ... my province.
No -- no, sir.
Go away -- hide yourself.
Yes, I know...
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
Maybe he'll get tubed.
Are you finished surfing?
You hear it again?
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
Sure.
What is this bridge?
Simple. They don't want him to go.
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Where's your chief supply officer?
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
95   CONTINUED:
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
Stay here.
It's exactly what you meant.
-- Permanently?
I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
Winter.  Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed.  Which would suit me fine.
High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too.
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Desmond.
New to the country, kid?
Does he have people?
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
Sounds like professional jealousy.
Stay put!
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
Yeah?
It was blown up with the plane.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
You broke the radio, remember?
Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.
Can you walk?
I got it from here.  Thanks.
Fuck you.
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
Get the fuck out of here.
Go easy.
It's Sam Wilder!
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
How was it talking to him?
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
It's amazing these things weren't done.
So what are you doing with a dog?
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
How do you know about my mother?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
What needs clearing up?
What's this?
Lovely.
You take off when you have to.
My son.
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
I was going to do that for you.
Thanks, Melvin.
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
Sex with Simon?
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
You know what? I...
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
Uh-huh...
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
Please, just leave.
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
What did she say?
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
Picking on me won't help.
What's it mean?
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
Why are you doing this?
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Uh, Fontella's
You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
Good afternoon.  We have reservations at the Hotel Paraiso in Costa Blanca.
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
Who is the mark?
The contract?
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
Yes.
Right.
Yeah.
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
Because I'm done.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
Why?
Because I want to know.
Did it ever bother you?
Thinking.
Not even a stalemate?
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
I paid a lot for these.
The sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  He will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
I told you, he will.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
Yes.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
Do you have ulcers?
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
Did he explain how this happened?
I'm sure you will.
Were you attracted to me right away?
Four minutes.
Okay.
Would you like a drink?
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Do you ever think about starting over?
You're pretty famous aren't you?
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
Can I ask you a question?
You wish to close this account today?
Cheers Katka!
How to make a buck!
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
You guys having a go a me or what?
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
No, why?
'cause you stink of booze.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
No, for the Asylum.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
Did you see anything in the files?
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
It's...42 56 76 .
I can't go with him.
Yes.
No!
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
Hmm, I see possibilities but you got a lot to do.
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
So, we won't be going to London?
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
Will it help to get you out?
But we could go to London and live in England.
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
Ah, so what?
I don't know - maybe they are talking about it now. Mr Vitovetch is a good friend of the Judge.
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
I had it coming from someone.
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Did you take your things over to my place?
Run into Josh?
Why don't we both forget about him?
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
Will you come home and forget all about him?
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
Have you lost all control of this city?
Kelly wouldn't do that.
'Bout what?
A late night or an early morning?
I could take after Dad, too.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
What are you doing here?
You.
I'm very sorry --
-- This your idea of small talk?
-- This play means a lot to me.
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Looking for intelligent life?
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
All of it.
She great or what?
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
Stand right here.
Are you trying to seduce me?
Can you locate XXI5639I?
One of your secrets.
You're worried about your college applications.
What are you going to -- ?
You know how to waltz??
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
I'm asking how much.
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
So talk to us about something.
Materially or spiritually?
I helped Jamie with the first one.
I thought she built it herself.
You've been well?
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
I'd do that --
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
Where did you get -- ?
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
I beg your pardon?
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
Huh?
I think I know exactly what you mean.
What do I say?
Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
What?!
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
You answered the door!
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
Marty,  I know I've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future, but....well, those loud bangs on the tape recorder....are they....
Pretty, isn't it?
Suzy!
How you doing, Cato?
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
What'd they look like?
What do you feed him?
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
No, you're not either.
You still in school?
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
He'll say that?
There you go.
You're a redhead.
I know.
Why not?
What a nice place.
Somebody else is going to get it.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Look at all this junk.
Don't.
Positive?
That's Montana over there.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
No.
What?
Yeah.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Fine.
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
Wanta sue me?
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
Dead.  Damnit!
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
You.  Like the papers all say.
Another 'you'?
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
A what?
Not here!  No Overthruster!
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
Is, uh... Is he okay?
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
If you could, I'd –
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
...Hello.
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
Yes... Isn't it?
Sound a little what?
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
Can be. Not easy, but –
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
And I could tell you some stories –
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell me?  Can't trade my head in for a new one.
No... I guess it's something about my work. I get so worked up over it, I don't know; I don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
...You're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
I've gotta call the police – or you could call for me –
What do you think happened?
Jesus... They can tell that...
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
It's more than I've got.
...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me – Charlie.
Mr. Lipnik, I –
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink – you're a goddamn write-off.
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
All of which he's now missin'.
Physician, heal thyself.
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
Yeah.
How is your -- personal life?
Yes.
What are you doing here?
Sometimes I really hate you.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?
Yes.
Because you didn't love him --
Even though you were fucking him.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
Didn't you study it in school?
I like you.
You can make a mistake.
Why take the risk?
How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
It's OK.  It's OK.
Can I talk to you a minute?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
I have to do some research tomorrow.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
Why not?
How did it end?
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
How did he die?
Yes I am.
Nilsen?
Was she ever a suspect?
Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
I never heard of him.
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
I don't know.  I'm just not.
I'm going with you.
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
Why do you think he's dead?
Who are you?
How old was she when this happened?
No. Should I have?
Let's get out of here.
What about the shit they write?
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
Ouch..
Do you still love her?
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Chill, man! Be cool! This isn't even my apartment!
MOTHAFUCKAH!
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
You're not?
Out?
It's Andy again.
Who am I?
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here – I made this for you.
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
... I'll buy you some new ones.
It's Monday morning.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
How is he?
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're –
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
It's three thousand dollars!
Me? Why?
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
Come on.
No, I'd like the scarf.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
A what?
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
'Phillips head,' right?
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
I need this?
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Where's the fire?
Hanging on every word.
Admiring your handiwork?
Better than you know, Bat-boy.
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
Silent night, violent night...
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
Wonder if it's worth my time.
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
What is it?
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
I am as well as can be expected.
It's good to see you.
What seems to be the problem?
That, sir, does not compute.
Oxbridge Academy?
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
I'm afraid to ask.
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
Mr. Freeze.
What are you talking about?
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
I see you knew him.
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
I wouldn't bet on that.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
But he's never said a word-
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
What say we turn up the heat?
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
The dreams again, sir?
I think they're getting worse.
What did you say?
Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick.
He ran away?
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
The _Rolls_?
There's one other thing. I feel..
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
And another name for Mystery?
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
I haven't had much luck with women...
Rinka.
It's a stretch but I'll manage.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
Well, I met someone...
He sure did.
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
Okay. I'm outta here.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
How could I forget?
Paranoid? The psychotic?
I got family. ...Please.
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
B-12.
Look! Police!
Can't we --
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
What did you see?
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
Boss! Jesus! They've --
And what happens if we say no?
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
He's not too bad.  I can live with him.
Annie, it's me.
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
And howls Alison?
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.
No!
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
What makes you say that?
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
Bye, Dad.
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
It is urgent, sir.
I am sorry you feel that way.
Shut up, Kevin.
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Heh heh. We're in Washington!
So, like, where is she?
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
That was boring. Huh huh.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Uh...
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.
Hey Butt-Head it's that chick!
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Dill-wad...
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Cut the power!
Where are his pants?
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
Uh, ten uh...
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
How's your arm?
Anything happen while I was away?
Cabin fever, hon?
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Here's something.
He might have hurt somebody.
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
You don't have an appointment, do you?
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
Wait for who?
Aren't you dead?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
We tried.
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
Are you Juno, our case worker?
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
And live in what, our station wagon?
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?

Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
Any particular kind?
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
What's wrong?
What do you think?
Viridian?
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
... He's gone, Chauncey.
Stay here? Is that necessary?
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
Would you care to take it, sir?
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
No. It won't do that.
... Why... No, I don't think so...
Hello, Eve.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Our greenhouse.
Oh, I like that very much.
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
Can you see well?
Ben is very ill.
I certainly do.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
I hope so.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, from the sound of our audience, I'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others...
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
But you won't sign, correct?
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Good. Anything else?
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
It's that serious, huh?
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
What?
Is the trial date set?
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
What?
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
How was it?
So how was it? What was he doing?
No they're not.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
What's that?
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
I know. I'm sorry...
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
Is that true?
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Yes, well...
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
Yikes.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
Vegas? What'd you think?
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
Do we get to wear a crown?
Oh, be still my heart.
I'm getting divorced.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
Why not? I need to get in there!
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
How do we do that?
Is there dancing?
Who's calling?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Darling!
No one would ever have to know its not him.
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
Bad dream, darling?
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Yeah what?!
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
YES.
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
You don't sit with me!!
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
Yes?
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
What you want'em for?
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
No. I mean work work.
Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
No, let her rest.
Morning.
Was over to Baby Suggs.
The church!
You?
That's so.
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
I don't believe that. I won't.
You got to get up from here, girl.
What, baby?
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
Yes sir.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?
What do you think?
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
They range up to three thousand.
Yeah.
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
Burkhalter.
Oh yeah, how'd it go?
Kill that poor woman.
Who has your undies, Walter?
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
He's handicapped, huh?
Are these.
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
I thought you might know, man.
Oh yeah?
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
The main guy, Dieter--
Dieter Hauff?
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
So...that doctor.
Am I wrong!
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
Hey Walter--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
...Huh?
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
Walter--
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
Uh.
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
Yeah, and you were--
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
He can't walk, Walter!
Walter, you fuck!
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Right, Dude.
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
Are you employed, sir?
Who the hell is he?
You come all the way down here to roust--
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
What?
Two years.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
Recognize him?
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
Why?
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
Thought you were dead.
And why is that?
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
We're locked in.
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
Going on twenty years now.
Pretty.
Stupidity.
Going somewhere?
Whistler, I --
You're too human, Blade.
Who is LaMagra?
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
What are you doing?!
I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
It's dark in here.
Are you all right?
It won't work on you.
Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it.
That's weird --
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself.
We keep in radio contact.
How did you escape?
--or incredibly fucking naive.
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
Try, please, Anna--
Domini?
Mrs. Leavitt--
The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
You feel no need to get married or anything.
--now c'mon!
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
Then I'm going--
Are you marked like this??
Absolutely.
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
Yeah.
You have to go.
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
--go!
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
So where the hell am I going to sleep?
No fucking.
What're you, crazy??
--yeah, a hand or something--
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
--turn the camera off--
What're you doing?
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
<u>What</u>?
Spite.
--it's less than four feet, just--
What is all this shit?
She got <u>paid</u>.
Ah, Domini?
What's that?
He'll never know.
You gonna be alright?
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
No. We <u>all</u> go.
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
No, I--
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
On the phone. Was it for you?
...Huh?
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart.
...But first I gotta know what happened.
...So?
Thanks.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Then what'd you come here for?
I want you to go fishing.
...Count it if you want.
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
What day is it today, Angie?
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Okay?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Not yet.
Hello, baby.
Frank?
You want to see him too, right?
Yes, but.
Look at these. What are these?
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Yes? What is it?
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Jeffrey nothing.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
Well.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
Do you like talk like that?
No.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
Whatiya mean?
Beeeee careful.
I asked first.
Who, Dorothy?
Hold me, Don.
What?
Yes.
There ya go.
Yeah, how did you know?
Yes.
That's too bad.
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Brilliant.
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
Okay. thanks.
What did you see?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Twice. without her sensing anything?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Oh yeah?
You worry about me really?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Where to?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Let's wait for some slow one.
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
Hi Dad.
How ya doin' Dad?
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
You can change it if you want to.
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Where do you guys want to count?
You happy, baby?
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
Excuse me?
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
I see.  How much?
What can I do for you guys?
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
You?
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
Yeah, I'm out.
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
How are we doing?
Good to see you, Diego.
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
Three million.  I counted it twice.
We're half a million off.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
You fucked me, Diego.
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
Today.
Surprised to see me?
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
Un sapo?
It's beautiful.
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
Sure.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
No, that's alright.
What?
Yeah.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
Yeah.
Well, here I am.  See?
What do you want from me?
You mean, like a trip?
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?
I know, Dad.  I love you too.
It's a four-man operation.  Two on the ground.  Two in the air.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
It's not enough.
Are we good?
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Sail.
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
It's good nobody is following us ...
No, and neither were my men.
Good evening ... Can we pass?
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
Of course I am.
Are you ready, colonel?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
Take some time off.
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
No questions.
Objection, Your Honor.
Why would she want that?
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Can I go?
No.
Why did you come by?
I had some papers to pick up.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
And how are you now?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
What happened after that?
Yes -- several times.
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
No.
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
Yes.
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
What changed?
What about Miss Lawson?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
P.M.
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
No.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Hi, Joe.
Do you think I did it?
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud.  They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
How?
Is it against the law?
I'm the photographer.
Yeah.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
What would?
Is that what you think I was thinking?
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
She's mistaken.
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
You were brilliant today.
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
Why?
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Alright, I'll talk to her
-- But it's Sunday.
This is not relaxing.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
I'll talk to him later.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
I'm not.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
It was a place to start.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Yes.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
Well, what am I supposed to think?
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
What do you know about "the changes"?
Maybe it's because I live here.
No, really?
Oh there you are.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
Lemon?
Mind if I smoke?
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
Clean?
Much.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
What?
Francesca?
Yes.
Francesca?
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
I told you, I love other people.
But no one in particular.
But it's not the same.
What made you ask such a question?
It's Robert.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
Yeah?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Have you ever been to that station?
Yes.
What?
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
WHY?
Then he can move! People move!
You feeling better Franny?
Where you going?
I can't sleep.
I'm going to miss you.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
What happened?
When did she decide this?
Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
You think that's really him?
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Have you ever been inside?
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
Lucky thing.
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
Yeah, you heard of him?
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
That building?
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
Just admit it, Caesar.
I think you're fucking crazy!
Caesar?  What is this?
What are you going to do with it?
There's no time.
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!
But you know he did it.
Got to think this through ...
...  maybe three hours.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
What happened to them?
Fuck.
Don't tell him --
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Caesar, don't.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
Where is it?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
You're doing everything yourself?
Yeah.
Truck.  Of course.
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
Okay, one drink.
Curious, maybe.
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
Basically.
I'm glad you did.
We're not that different, Corky.
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
An accident.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
It's me.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
Done.  We go now.
Johnnie, what did I say?
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
I know you've been trying to kill me.
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
We have to go home, Jason.
Right.
Sir, you waited on line.
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
We thought you were gone for good.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
I need a ride out of here.
Oh, Jesus... 
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
What does that mean?
No.
What are you talking about?
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
I needed a break.
So this is it, right?
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
He's dead isn't he?
I trusted you.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
Oh, Jesus...
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
Nykwana Wombosi. 
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
xxxxxx
Who is it?
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
What?
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
Where am I?
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
...Be back.
...elephoned sir.
What have you got there?
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
...ven't you?
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
I'm waiting for my daddy.
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
Remember how they used to stick out?
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Tell me about Layton.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
Is it stamped?
Where do I get it stamped?
Who are you? Let go!
Ow! That hurt!
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
You know, smoking's bad for you.
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Where are you taking me?
Looking for you.
No, really.
Well, all wars do -
Well, terrorists of course.
Look at that - right on time.
Security.
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
Get away!
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
He is dead.
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
Hello ... hello ...
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
Dead.
IB Bangin.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Do you have any music?
Did you see my father?
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
How is she?
He's better, though, right?
He's better.
Not as good as Nino's.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
I think I'd remember that.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
I think the worst is over.
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
Who's that?
She's no whore, Marcus.
He one of them?
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
No.
Whatja doing?
Who with?
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job.
What?
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
And the rule was...
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
It's not loaded.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
Yes.
He must have been great-looking, right?
Watch? --
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
No.
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
This isn't friendship.
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
Speaking.
So who's the guy?
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
Your hair's a little funny.
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
What is she shooting?
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
Goodbye, Paul.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
He said something about...
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
Yes.  That's right.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Anchor?
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Bye, sweetie.
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
Billion.
You okay?
Yes.
It's not important.
Who?
Because you're nuts.
What?
What happened?
What?
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
This is very awkward.
So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
Where's the bathroom?
If you were an artist you could have created something!
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Look -  This pose is all wrong!
Anything new?
What the hell's going on?
What did he do?
You really like it?
Are you ready?
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
I know, man.
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
Well I was uh, just looking...
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
You didn't mean to what?
It's hot in here...
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
You don't have to do anything!
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
Figures.
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Benny, man, where you been?  You bailed on me, I passed out, man, I almost did a Jimi Hendrix!
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
What's Bobby gonna say?
Nothing.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
Didn't you get my message?
You left me a message?
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
Where are you gonna go?
I'll back that up.
Hey, Buffy...
Yeah?
For the dance.
I'm going to the dance.
What for?
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
Like what?
Beverly Center.
I don't see why we have to invite everyone.
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
What are you talking about?
Wait!
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
Yes.
I have cheerleading squad.
Oh, him.
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Sporting events, yeah.
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Put your head back.
Oh, several.  Lucretia Borgia, Joseph Mengele, Franklin Pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
That is so cool.
Thank you very much.
I can't!
I don't understand.
Oh, yes!  Yes!
Buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the Olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
Buffy!
God!  Take a chill lozenge.
I really was way way too too.
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
No...  You want me to give him a message?
You mean Nuke.  You said "Crash".
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
I did.
We lost.
I'd like you to meet my father.
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
Crash, I didn't think you--
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
See my hips?
But you were pulling your hips last night.
You're pulling your hips out.
I doubt that.
I'm ready for a complicated man.
What's so great about baseball?
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
Who's he play for?
Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.
You missed the tag!
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
You been in the Majors?
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Party without me.
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
What do I gotta do?
Boring.
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
Look at yours.
Hi, Ace.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
A powerful man.
He even played golf with the President.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
Hey!
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
Somethin', huh?
Ohh!
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
In so many words, yes.
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
Yes, you lost your control.
All right.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
Please...
It's none of my business?
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
Ginger called me.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
No problem.  Sorry.
What can I do?
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me?  I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
Why're you crying?
Yeah.
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
Huh?
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
Yeah, how do I know?
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
It's under...
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?
Would you knock it off, Sam?
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
I threw it away.
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
You get down here!
Oh, you are...
I am calm!
After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway.
What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
...Well, I've got a large family.
How many kids do you have?
Eight children! 
Loose machines are right back over there.
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
Look what they did to my hand, man!
Mm.
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
You gotta go back out there.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Nicky, I did -
I did - I didn't -
Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
He's comin' over.
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
Hm.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
Ace.
Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian- American slang for 'Come here']
Mm.
Uh-huh. Good.
Tell me.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
Listen, Ginger... you know, this is probably not... I don't have the answers anyway... and this is probably not what you want to hear right now, because you're a little upset with Ace.
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
Thank you.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
...same outfit.
That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
All right.
You are.
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
No, Lester.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
Listen...
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
Stacy. 
You must have drunk too much.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Take it easy!
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
Do I hear a motion seconded?
There's a lot of people here.
Again!
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
The crowd bought it.
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?

No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
Selina, are you okay?
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
Hello, Spooky.
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Next time, call...
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
I don't know if I can do it alone.
This is one way.
I don't see anybody in there but you.
Don't you have children?
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
What's this?
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
Make a "U" and go back.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
I improved on the fucking original.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
You don't understand.
I don't want to know --
Oh won't I?
Don't lay this on me!
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
What do you mean?
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Don't say that.
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
What did you do?
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
Why can't it be her?
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
They put their hands all over me.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
Damned if I know.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
I thought it was inspired.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
What's happening?
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
Naturally.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Know what else is in here?
Who are you working for?
Got a phone in that van?
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
Seems like it.
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
Yeah?
Yeah?
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
Hold on.
So let's call this the usual.
Saw that one.
That's what he said. Jimmy.
Saw it, Dil.
It's him, isn't it?
Scottish?
How'd you guess?
Hi.
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
What would he think?
Want to look after you.
You mean that?
What you thinking of, hon?
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Do you care, Jimmy?
I said stop it.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
So I'm sorry.
Ask to meet me again.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
So I got it wrong, then.
What's her?
She from Scotland too?
Why?
For me.
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
You heard what I said, Dil?
Are you supposed to take that many?
Your soldier.
No.
Why?
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Yes.
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
Stop it, Dil --
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
Need to lose myself awhile.
He's hot.
Yes.
Leave her out of this.
Dil!
Give him a cup of tea.
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
So he knows your name?
I told him.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Why do you want to do that for?
So it was you all the time.
Who'd you think it was?
So what do you think that is, Hennessy?
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Can't.
They won't let him die.
Not in your nature.
No.
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
And you play cricket?.
Nice to meet you, Fergus.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Hurry up, would you?
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Having a pint in the Rock.
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
I've often wondered how you do it.
What do you believe in?
I didn't.
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
I said you bastard -- stop --
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
What?
Who gives a fuck.
I never know nothing.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
It was fun while it lasted.
Have you no feelings, woman?
Where are you, ol' buddy?
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
That's right.
Why do you think I brought you here?
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
I said, tell me to go to the --
Reggie -- listen to me --
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Agent.
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
Who?
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
Very good.
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
What now?
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
Back where?
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Why you lied to me.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Cutting it out.
That sounds like their problem.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Maybe.
Alex --
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
I don't believe it.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
How much is it worth?
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
But his mother --
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
Of course it is.
Up there! It is up there!
I don't know -- how would I know?
Quitter.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Oh. I guess.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Come on. You can't stay here.
Don't you understand French?
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
What are you doing in here?
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
Go on.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
Please stop -- please!
Because I don't love him.
Didn't Charles have any friends?
Do you know him?
What is it about?
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
What's he up to?
I'm glad. But what's all this?
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
Not my imports.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
So?
Daddy you scared me!
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
No honey.
Who is she Daddy?
What happened?
Well?
Hello?
You gave me a 'D'.
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
Who?
Why?
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
I was desperate. It was gross.
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
Not that many.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
Why?
If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
Jody. Wait.
Mom?
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
Attacked how?
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
Kenny's aunt?
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
So are you.
Maybe it won't stay in.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
Stacy?
What, do you work for my boss, dog?

Where do you want this stuff?
Great. 
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
Why don't I--?

Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
What the hell's goin' on?
Am I missing somethin' here?
I did not steal this truck!
I ain't playin' that.
God-...

Doesn't work.
What?
Okay.
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
...waiting!

...man!
...up!
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...

...do we?
That's right.  Now,  move!

I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Come on, old...
...Pete.  Come on.
Whoo!
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
 Gee, you think so?
No.  Shit.
Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay. 

I don't want you to come anyway. 
Oh, no!

It won't even start half the time.
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
...overdrawn bank accounts.
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
How wonderful for you.
Listen, Arlo...
 Whoo!
Arlo, shut up.
Reach into my pocket.
Oh.
 All right.  Okay.

Arlo!


Okay, here we go.

Stop.

...here comes the...
Shoot me. 

Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.

Stop limpin' around like that.
Hello.
Us.  Owes us.
Yeah.
That was quick.

...about him.
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead...

Well, well, well.
I did what I could for you...
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
So you called the damned thing Elvis

Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
And I changed the schedule.
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
Now listen to me.
...destroyer of worlds."
...that.
Mm-hm.
...always done, Richard?
Good to see you again, Leo.
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
I'll do it.

Carl!  Set up the camera.
What about these two?
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
Is this your establishment?
....-lene.
...deer.

You'd never understand!

...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
...somehow. 
Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--?
Thanks. 
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
Excellent.
...is a perfect hunter.
Turn the power of the hunter against him.
...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
Mason.
The compound has to be kept cold...
You're the only one I can trust.
Dr.  Long!
We've got the real thing!
Where are you now...
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
Got that?
...stole a truck under arrest.
What the hell was that?
Get in 

Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.
Sir?
Thanks.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Who's the investigating officer?
Where from?
None.
That's too bad.
Yeah.
No. She's probably scared to death.
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
What about her?
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
Avocado groves?
What is it?
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
Sure thing.
In the garage.
You sure this is okay?
I said okay, Jake.
Why?
You've done well by yourself.
I get by.
Looking for someone.
I'd like to talk to him.
No?
I don't.
Isn't that your number?
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
What pictures?
And why's that?
What's the maid's address?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Iced tea.
Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
What do you mean?
I got your check in the mall.
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
Is there anything else you want to know?
That your maiden name?
Yes... why?
How did it happen?
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Another satisfied client?
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
What are you thinking?
That dam is a con job.
They can't be.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
When was the last time?
Why?
What were you doing there?
...No. Why was it.
And I want to know where.
I saw him.
You didn't tell me.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
Aren't you coming back with me?
Upstairs. Why?
Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
That's good. Now what's her name?
Katherine?... Katherine who?
Back to Mexico.
I'll take care of it.
I'm all right.
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
Who?
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
He never even kids about it.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
I said, the northwest valley.
Well, no.
The water.
Yeah.
It's not completely dry.
Can't we talk about this alone, Mr. Gittes?
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Mr. Mulwray, please.
May I ask what this is regarding?
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
They were partners.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
Well, you never know, do you?
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
Yes. I want proof.
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
You understand now? You see it clearly?
Hi, Elena!
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here.  Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing...  I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic! 
No...
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
I can't take shorthand.
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
I might make him nervous.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Enthusiastic?
He made an awful lot of money.
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
I know it is, Brad -
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -
You really don't know who I am?
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
Half past eleven.
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
Impossible!  Impossible!
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
Yes, sir. 
Can't say, sir.
It's been a tough day.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Good.
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
I'm drunk.
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
I know you will.
Hello, Brad.
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
It's a letter from her lawyers.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
Thompson!
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
What about that apartment?
Jesus!
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
I was here the whole time.
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
You're just going to lock the store like that?
And you said yes?
No, you're not really getting married?
How like her.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
I just told you.
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
You don't have anything to do with it.
You lie.
Look how full of yourself you are.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
What about Sing?
I'm just kidding.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
Stop this. This isn't funny.
What time was this?
I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
We did.
Yeah.
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
In a second!
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
Well, he missed!
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
You open?
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
You only brought one ball?!
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
What smells like shoe polish?
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
No, thanks.
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
Eight and a half.
Eight and a half?
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
I think it's safe to say yes.
All four?
All right, Vader's boss...
There's more?
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
There aren't.
Thirty-seven!
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
Jesus.
Number six.
You hardly knew her!
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
Let me borrow your car.
May I be blunt with you?
What the fuck did you do that for?
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
No way!
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
Really?
You're lying.
I'm happy.
There's no lights back there.
She said she did all the work.
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
Do I know you?
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
How much can you bench?
Oh for God's sake!
Yeah?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
I'm trying.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Why did you agree to come in then?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
You're trusting.
How do you figure?
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
And I actually date you?
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
How many?
It better be up to and including me.
You!
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
He requested this?
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
Sure.
What the fuck did you do that for?
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
It stings a little.
What's this?
You said you were here all day?
That's tight. Solid.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
I hope it feels good.
You'll be missed.
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
I'm not sad.
The guy ain't here yet.
I know. I've been here since eleven.
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Twenty bucks?
I will. Take it easy.
What?
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
C-4?
He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff?  Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft.
Go on, fetch.
Tucker?
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
Glad you could drop in.
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
She's losing it!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
I did what I thought was right.
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
Can I count as fast as I like?
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
You couldn't.
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
He can handle it.
Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Yeah?
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Gabe are you alright?
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Thanks for holding on.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Forget it!  I refuse!
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
What's he doing?
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
On top of the peak.
He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Where's the third one, Travers?
Get off my back, Qualen!
What's the code, Travers?
No names, this is an open line!
Rich...
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
What did you do that for?
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
I've been cured.
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
I did, sir.
Good.
Good evening, my boy.
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
Well, who can blame them, sir?
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
What do I want?
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
Alexander de Large, sir.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Are you an Epileptic?
No, sir.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
Oh.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
What's all this about sin?
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
Don't read it - sign it!
Yeah... Pete the English.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Shall we go to my office?
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
The ride is free.
Not quite.  He did defense.  I'm a prosecutor...
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
...he's two floors below you.
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
You still carrying passengers?
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?
What's your name?
I got caught up at work.
I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go.
You hassling my driver again?
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
Hello?
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
You on some kind of work plan?
You mean like benefits?
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
Please.  Don't do anything.
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
I can't believe this.
I don't understand...
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
Limos, huh?
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
In case he asks.
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
You had to kill Heller?!
What's at Union Station?
That's what you said...
What'd they do?
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Max?
Drop me off here!
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Mississippi?
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
I better get going.
You switched the charts; you tell me.
For what?
He says a dog bit his nose.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
Pretty scary, huh?
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
We're going to Queens?
Where are we going, Jerry?
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
Did you kill my father?!
They'll trace it.
I love you, too.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
I don't know...
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
Terminal?
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
It's okay.  I'm game.
Yes.
You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
There's no plug to pull.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
I don't understand.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
What...
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
Can you show me?
So.  What happens now?
That isn't the way it works.
No more stalling, Captain.
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
A page-break signal.  A period.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
And in return?
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
And where exactly does that put your position...?
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
How do you mean?
Yes.  Very much.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
What?
-- I don't know --
Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
But I made this arrangement --
You don't take another man's place, boy.
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
What are you doin' here?
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
Here, Mom.
What went wrong?
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
What's all this dirt in the yard?
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
Borrowin'.
Whatcha got?
But there's still daylight left.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'!  You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
That fool. That damn fool.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
Kick a buck.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
But -- but --
No. No chains either.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
What?  What'd I do?
I can't, Andy.
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
Where is it?
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
No.  Not yet.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
Is that it?
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
What's that siren?
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Classy madonna.
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
So what have we got?
You're damn right I do.
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
You want mine, too?  You take his, you take mine.  I'm the one fucked it up...
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
Not a lot of action here.
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
What!? They brought the car here?
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
One of your suitors?
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
Are we allowed to park here?
No.
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
What does he want from you?
Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
How?
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
You look beautiful.
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
What's his name, Letty?
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Are you sure, Dear?
Tell us every detail.
Mom, please.
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
I'm really not that hungry.
Green spot.
Chair, cup and ball.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
What are you looking to read?
But you're checking it out.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
Wow.    I'm bad news.
Shocking, huh?
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
I have a terrible confession.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
I do.
Michael, I...
Not a one.
Furnished?
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
Hey.
Yeah?
The restaurant, too?
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
Silly, silly, silly.
I guess we need to talk.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
You don't have a fever.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
Do you know who this is?
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
It's Daniel.
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
Why are you here?
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
But you were there?
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
I assume you want something?
And the other half?
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
I don't know.
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
Yeah.   We just go home.
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
Bring me the scissors.
Turn on the flashlight.
Do they come with batteries?
You didn't buy batteries?
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
Good idea.
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
I was told to take what we have and go.
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
They sort of got away.
Anybody know about that car outside?
How are we going to do that?
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
Glenmorangie.
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
When do we go?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
You got it in a bar?
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
I'm just playing around.
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
Please sit.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
You say she killed a policeman?
You, sister...
They forced me to marry!
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
Shu Lien...
It's Jade Fox!
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Fucking A, my friend.
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
It's only a flesh wound.
Mom --?
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
It's just the dope, don't worry
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
Mom tried to cook.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Another jolly nickname?
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Shelly?
Miss her?
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
What... the hell is that?
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
I'm Kathryn.
Excuse me?
What do you mean?
You promise not to say anything?
On my mother's life.
Great book.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
You implied it.
Shut up.
Need a lift?
It was fine.
You don't even know me.
Yes.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Wait, don't hang up.
Need any company?
Because I'm in love with you.
Why aren't you understanding?
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
The football stud?
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
Where did you find those?
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
I don't know.
Why?
Who is it?
What do I do then?
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
Excellent.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
What are you doing?
Want to join me?
Need any company?
I know.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Good luck, Sebastian.
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
Pretty sure or sure sure?
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
What do you mean?
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
Sounds intriguing.
Be more specific.
Interesting.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
Who are you spying on?
Yeah.
What's your problem?
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
Morning.
Kind of.
It was... Fantastic.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
You wanted an answer to your question.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
Come again?
Get off me!
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
You will be discreet about this?
Let me get that for you.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
She's out.
Annette! Annette!
We played backgammon?
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
Did you hit her?
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
What do you mean?
What are saying, darling?
Did you ever make a wish?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
Irena.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
I know that.
It's early yet.
I'm never unfair.
You're shouting at me.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
Yes, I did.
But wishes don't come true.
I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
Daddy, it's true.
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
What'd you get for Christmas?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
Who are you?
The numbers simply don't mean anything
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
Don't cry, Amy.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
But why?
Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
But she's such a nice lady.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
Because it can't. It's dead.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
Hurry, hurry.
I hate the storm. I hate it!
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
Does she have PMS?
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
I don't know.
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
Where?
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
So did you do it?
What? Why the hell did he do that?
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
Give him the tampon test.
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
He's been here all night?
What happened to his tooth?
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
You expecting someone?
No.
I think I just got my period.
You're such a good friend.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
Yes I do have to pee!
You look different. I mean you look good.
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
On your desk.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
Briefs.
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
No, why?
How do you know?
What about... those guys... I might have...
I'm going to take a shower.
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
I ate a guy last night.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
We didn't have sex.
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
You want her sheets?
You're some catch Lloyd.
He was found a few blocks away.
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
I need something to keep me awake.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
Not really...
Dammit!
You wonít regret this, sir.
Why, yes.
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
Where do you think this goes?
Which one?
You see it?
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
But I...
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
I'm nothing then.
I'm sorry.  About before.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
Why?
They barely talk anymore.
Holy cow.
Mr. President...
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
I don't give a shit.
TilT we figure something out.
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
Clean.
Oh.  Excuse me.
He's only doing what you told him to.
It's not his job -- It's my job!
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
What happened?
I'm afraid so.
In the car?
Thanks, I wrote it.
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
Really?
We'd like to hire you.
I can't say.
No.
What about it?
You're kidding.
What are you staring at?
What?
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
Anybody would have done it.
Where are you going?
How were you gonna get home?
Are you hungry?
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Tonight?
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
Gasparilla?
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
It's because of me.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
I'm not?
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
All right.  I'll second that.
Where'd you find them?
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
Chris!
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
Yes sir.
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
What did the name mean.  Did you only read dead poets.
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
Yeah.
Too bad.
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
But father, I'm assistant editor.
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
Father!
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
Yes.  But
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
They're putting it on at Henley Hall. See, open try-outs.
Come on, that's impossible.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
They are...they are everywhere.
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
Which question is that?
And no questions asked.
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
What is it?
Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.
Finnegan, what the hell was that?
I don't know...you got what we need?
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
I've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport...
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
And what have you come up with?
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
What the hell does that mean?
What is it man?
Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
Those are mine!
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
Who's full of shit?
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
Who? Who is?
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
I got delayed. I --
Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
No. None of that.
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
Oh. Fine.
Those fuckin' niggers. This time I'm going to eat balls!... You ever try 'em?
Oh, well...
Holy shit!
Not so good.
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Here.
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Okay.
Sure.
I'm just so lonely.
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
Is he from here?
It's ahead, by the tree.
Hey, Nick?
We what?
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
More bullets in the gun?
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
That's it. No. No way.
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
Yeah.
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
No.
How's it feel, huh? How's it feel to be back?
No.
You're full of shit!
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
Remember my promise.
We have to talk.
Just great.
Bacon cheeseburgers.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
Good night, Wade.
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
Sanchez...?
...What are you talking about...?
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
No.  I want to be with you.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
You know that you're in my house.
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
Howdy, Jabez.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
She couldn't be gone!
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.
You are afraid!
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
The seventh day of April --
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
What -- what's on your mind?
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
How much?
Jabez -- help!
Down, Shep! Down!
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
Mary--
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
But I'm glad to be home again --
Worried!
I am going to lock him up.
Mary! Come back ...
You found it in the barn, hey?
Ma -- is she? --
You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
It's all right, Sheriff.
Let him try it.
Hello, Sheriff.
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
You aren't angry with me?
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
Hey there, Dan'l! Black Dan'l!
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?
Hans, he killed by brother --
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
John!
Yeah.  How'd you know?
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
Roy?  You still with us?
Yeah?  What's the odds?
Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
Roy?
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
Yessir.
This is --
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
Hey, don't take the car!
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
So... that sure is something.
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
You're really crazy.
Denmark?  Sweden?
I gotta listen to it if they think...
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Yeah... yeah.
I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever.
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
I'm afraid.
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
You alone, or you got confederates?
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
What do you want to know that for?
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
Yeah?
I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.
I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
Everything's all right?  You okay?
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
Did you always call him Junior.
I used to, but I stopped.
You stopped?  Why?
Where's the money?
I want him to think that.
Dead or alive?
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
Okay - you got your one.
I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Oh my God, mother!
Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
Not now, Mom, please.
I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that?  I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
<i>Well... I think that these are the gentlemen who robbed us. I'm also a bail bondsman out of Los Angeles. I can track down and deliver these crooks to you... for a small finder's fee of course.</i>
Who the hell is that?
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
Yes.
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.

Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
What?
Make it plain.
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
Good morning.
I hope the block is still standing.
OK.  OK.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
I'll do.
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
How many you say?
Here ya are.  Keep the change.
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
Let it be broke.
Can ya dig it?
It's dug.
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
I know I haven't seen you in four days.  I'm a working man.
I can run out and get it.
A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
What else?
It's cold.
It's 'pose to be cold.
You really think so?
Pino, get a broom and sweep out front.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
But I came here to learn about America.
Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww.
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Yeah...
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
I don't follow.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
I haven't seen you around here before.
No, it's a treasure map.
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
Oh, is this your special place?
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
Exactly! A pirate!
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
Shut up!
You take that back!
Our own special bus.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
I bet you want your head scratched.
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Are, too.
You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Hold up. First, we have to decide who gets who, remember? No more competition?
Try one in a million!
I thought I told you to get lost.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
Yes, what?
That's my boyfriend.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
You know I do!
LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
Obviously.
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
I am strong!
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
It's the big potato.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
And...?
You got the Extender?
Where is it?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
So the chest is still out there somewhere.
This is horse?
So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
I can assure you...
Is this what you seek?
This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
Remove her gag!
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
Who are you?  What do you want?
Thank you.
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Do you want me to get it for you?
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
What is this place?
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
But maybe not.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Really?  I don't feel so great.
Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
Eddie, how was I?
I don't know.  Where?
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
Wow.
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
I don't know.  It's so much money...
I'm no good.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
But you used to say --
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
That's not true --
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Can I help you?
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Is there a script?
No, he's not dead!  He lives in Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
What are you making?
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
How long's he been here?
You look beat.
I am.  How's your father?
That <u>is</u> incredible!  You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
I don't know.
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
What if--you're vomiting?
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
They celebrated the common person.
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
You thought it was me?
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
What?
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
How you doing, Ed?
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
Yeah?!
Yeah.
Leave her be.
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Ed --
Ed --
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
What?
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
Are the TV people with you?
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when I thought you came into our lives --
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Oh my god! On TV!
But Al is your husband now!
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
I can't?
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
Well, then I'm quitting.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
You do though, you look great.
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
So...?
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
I'm sorry.
Come on, let's go.
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
No... Could you?
What are you drunk?
Yeah. I service video equipment.
Thumbsucker!
I'm making a tape.
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Why me?
... Ray?
I know.
Look, we gotta talk.
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
Hello.
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
I was in jail.
No. Two times.
We have to stop meeting like this.
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Can I help with anything?
By the X.
That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code.  The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.
what?
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
Yeah, just --
You're kidding, right?
I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
Walt needs to see you.
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
Right now?
Okay, let's say
Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
What?
What...?
People can see this.
For what?
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
Don't you fucking knock?
What do you want?
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
It's Lynn.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
Yeah.
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
Will you work for me?
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
Was it... a rat?
Lynn.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
Let's just kill them.
You expecting problems?
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
Nothing.
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
I don't own no shotguns.
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Dudley, we've been over this.
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
You're the key witness?
What?
I need to speak to you.
So what's the point?
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
I'm curious about you.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
None.  Call it a hunch.
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
And Reynolds?
This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Oh Jesus.
And you were the last one to talk to him.
Nothing.
Turn on CNN.
It is?
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
I don't know who he is.
Who was that other guy?
The NSA?
You're crazy.
Wait.
Yeah.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
Jesus!
I called my wife!
I intercepted phone calls.
The NSA killed him.
What's going on?
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
Gimme that.
That wasn't so hard.
No he won't.
What if we just fucked with 'em?
Feeling lucky?
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Pardon?
You tell me.
Somebody took my blender.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Uh-oh.
I'm sorry.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
He's got his priorities?
"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
I've seen it.
You <u>swore</u>!
Stacy, don't hang up.
I know.
It wasn't me.
That was for Christmas.
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
What is it?
Maybe it's not connected yet.
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
Is this a fuckin' joke?
I don't believe it is, no.
Why the hell would I--
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
Actually, that's not true.
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
And then what?
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Never.
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
It's how he works.
Brill?
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Thank you.
What are you talking--
Why?
You're learning a cruel lesson.
Can I open 'em up?
Really?
Dad!
Who won the fight?
Alright!
Into what?
Christ!
Ssh!
Bobby--
Jesus.
Why would they--
No, I--
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Bobby? Piece of advice?
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
You would?
Then what's your goddam opinion?
We found the originals.
The originals?
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
He's clever. He had help.
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
You're kidding me.
So they know everything.
Puffed cheese?
No thank you.
Pardon?
This is not very good, is it?
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
I'm impressed you can sew.
You sew very badly.
No.
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
It's so cold.
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
You too.  Good luck!
Sorry, what's your point?
Could I trouble you for some water?
I see.
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
What did you think you were doing in his tent?
In my room.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Shut-up!
I don't know.
They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg in…have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
Ask him.
What if I told you he did this to me?
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
I'm fine.  I got hot.
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Apprentices.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
He needn't disturb you.
Your friend?
That's a different dress.
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
Why would anyone do this?
I try not to expect you.
I mean home.  India.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
Hello miss.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
Does he have to go?
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
Go away.
How awful.  What will you do?
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
No.
Mac's signature.
Why didn't I think of that?
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
I don't know, but close.
Don't overestimate yourself.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
I have a question...
Mr. MacDougal.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
You...you can't.
Maybe I should drive this time.
It's a test.
I don't believe this.
And good morning.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
So how long to pop the floor?
Got it.
You're nervous again.
You were afraid of heights?
Ready?
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
Peoples China Bank.
So how long till we do this?
That was a lifetime ago.
And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...
The door's the only way out!
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
Oh, it is.
You look like George Washington.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
Remind me why.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
She's calling the shots now.
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
Right.
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
The judge came up with a number.
Oh, my God.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
Where's Anna?
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
Erin --
It's not about working hard --
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
What do you mean?
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
What kind of things come up?
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
Erin --
Ho - ly - shit.
Here what comes?
The extortion, the threats ...
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
Pattee?  That your middle name?
Can I play roller hockey?
Randy's mom said yes right away.
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
She's one of the sick people?
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
What?  But you been working so hard --
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
That's okay.  I understand.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
Uh-huh?
Yes?
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Howls.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
Yeah ...
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
You know the Jedi Master?
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
You, too, golden rod.
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
An Imperial probe droid.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
That was no earthquake.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
I don't like this.
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
Thanks to you.
Probe?  What probe?
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
What'd you say?
What?
Someone's falling.
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving East.
Rather touchy, aren't they.
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
But tell me why ...
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Did you call the Zoo?
Good God.
So am I.  And I mean you no harm.
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
We shall want a full autopsy ...
Primitive?
May I say something personal?
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
I'm already dead.
What's the little black box do?
Having second thoughts?
Lock fuel rods.
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
What're you doing in here?
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
Who?
Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
Good day to you, sir.
Yield. I have the advantage.
Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
A king must marry, after all.
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
Excalibur! Is it true?
What is this place, Merlin?
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
Why can't you be my champion?
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
The law forbids it.
A lovestruck page!
You are truly magnificent!
I should butcher all and every one of them. Merlin, what is this wagging of tongues?
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
I?
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
What didn't he tell you?
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
Yes, I go now.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
Excuse me Miss?
What!
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
No I didn't know you had one.
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
Oh yeah, since when?
But how?
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
Are you sure?
You like it?
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Well I heard differently.
I don't know, I just thought.
Why does God let us get tired?
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
Where'd you get it then?
I stole it.
Lieutenant?
Who's in it?
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
Dimmy, you worry for something?
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
And let my cry come unto thee.
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
Hey, Father? You like movies?
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Come on!
Who?
MERRIN!!!!!!!
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
Are you comfortable Regan?
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
Trunks?
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Honey ...
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Honey ...
Piano.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
Recognize these two characters?
That's not the point.
What's wrong with it?
Lotta water.
Huh?
Jack...
I hate your kids, Frank.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
What d'ya got?,
Bosen black.  Flat.
Why the interest?
You gotta go.
Yeah?
What're you talking about?
Nice, huh?
Terrific.
A gust of wind killed him.
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
Where the hell is she?
It's not gonna hurt you.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
See anything?
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
You all right?
You recognized me.
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
Last?
I thought we had separate rooms.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
Why would I mind?
Right.  I love you, Frank.
Funny, huh?
He was wearing a suit.
Celebrating.  Join me?
Expensive hangover.
A useless talent.
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
You always threw up.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
Go ahead.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Charlie called.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
The flu.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
We're a team.  We work together.
Where's your dress?
Save it for your wife.
They're nines.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
Give me that.
You're kidding me.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
They must've bought the same map we did.
Huh?
What's with you guys?
Uh ...
What're you talking about?  They love it.
Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Funny job.
Don't worry about it.
Right.  Bring him back.
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
Every year.
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
In and out.
How do you do it? Every night?
What'd I say?
Nothing.
All I said was you were good.
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.
He had a mind that escalated things.
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
Frank said ---
Yeah... No.
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
Jack.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
The recent past.
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
Big piece or little?
None?
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
For what?
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
How did he expect to do that?
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
What do you mean?
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Would it?
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
I'm just having some fun.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
What do you know about it?
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
-- what?
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Great.
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
Oh, that Karl.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
So you left her?  Just like that?
Adelle?
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
Good for you. Why shouldn’t you protect what’s yours.
Fighting’s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
Is it...?
Damn...
She wants to have an affair with me.
She said that?
It wouldn’t really be cheating...  It’s complicated.
We bowl together. We’re bowlers ...we won a championship...we’re winners.
Yes...Jack Campbell...
What the hell are you talking about?  What’s he talking about?
Got a minute, Jack?
Me?
You just said everyone needs something.
That’s my car!  You stole my car!
No?  C’mon, Jack...I’ve got everything I need, I don’t have regrets, that’s just not for me... sound familiar?
You?  What about me?  I’m working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
I don’t think so, thank you...
If you’re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
No, you’re right.  What are we doing?
Where were you?
Yes, I’m fine.  It’s just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
...my feet are hurtin’...
Uh...that baby’s crying...
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
You want the cake!?
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
But you always seem so certain.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
I’m out of the doghouse?
Pretty incredible, isn’t it?
So what’s the big surprise? You didn’t rent this place for the weekend, did you?
I’m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
I promise, Jack...
Promise me again...
Kate...
What’s going on?
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I’m going to be heading it up.
Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
Not by a long shot.
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
For one thing, you like expensive things.
That’s easy. You’ve seen my car.
Last night was great...
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
How'd you know it was me?
I can't take this.
Five times.
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Ben.  Are you okay?
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  Ben...
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
What is this?  Where's Reed?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber.  It's muscle, tendon.  I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
And where do we think we're going?
I though we went over this.
Stop it.
Then what is it?
Not until Ben is back inside!
Ben did this.
Feeling better?
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
What are you doing?
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
You <u>were</u>?
Why didn't you say something?
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
It's just business.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
What's going on?
Reed's gonna fix me up --
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
You mean <I'm> going along?
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
Open it! Open it before they get here!
Such as?
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
What about Dr. Michaels?
Tell them to take us out.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
That line was tampered with...
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
I don't believe that.
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Certainly -
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
Where is Pancakes Hause?
...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?
Clear him off the road.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Yah.
Ya got that right.
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
Yah.
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
Well, what do ya mean?
...Dad?
...Is everything okay?
I mean a parking lot.
Stan and I're okay.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Mm.
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
You look in his citation book?
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
Yah?
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
No, I didn't...
Hello?
Yah, is this Marge?
Linda.
Oh, fine.
They announced it?
Yah.
Oh, my.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
Hmm?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
Who do you think could've done this?
Sure.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
You can't have the whole brain!
In case we want to switch nights.
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
Here.
When?
You hear that?
That... sawing and hammering.
Is this a trick?
We did make love?
Say my name!  What's my name!?
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
What?
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
What do you do, Tyler?
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
Strange.
Call what off?
What fight?
Hum.
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
If you could fight any celebrity?
Hemingway.  You?
Unbelievable, huh?
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
We don't need him...
Fucking sweet.
I asked you what you studied.
I feel sick.
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
This conversation...
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
She's... you... you're fucking her.
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
Tyler...
Ask me nicely.
Defuse the bomb, please.
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
What?
Appreciate something.
Maintenance.
You told me you'd say that, too.
Robert Paulson?
You're welcome to join our club.
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Would you rather be dead?
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
Signs?
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
I tried calling last night but your father --
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
This place?!
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
Cuticle lacerations.
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
You read me, Brewer?
What's that?
It's a guy in a cage.
Roundeye.
Alright.  Home run.
That guy's not going to make it.
You comin'?
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
Thanks.
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
I know.  I go with you.
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
Why me?
All this is for us?
Typical...
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
Black.  No sugar.
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
This mission was a scam from the word go?
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
American.  Come to get you out.
Colonel.
Will it hurt?
Well, there's nobody special!
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
No really..I can't.
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
What does that mean?
Hello....congratulations.
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
What?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
But..How could that happen?
Tragedy?
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
Yes... I... I agree...
Fine.  I'll say no.
Your name was picked.
So how do we do this?
Do you know what the Little People just told me?
They said you're The One.
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
Parry... I'm Jack.
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
That's O.K.
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
SAW WHO!!?
What?
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
OWWW....What are you nuts?!
Are you all right?
Well, it's enough for me.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
What are we about to do?
I don't drink coffee...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself...  You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?
Is it my turn again?
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
I love it.
Who said I was depressed?
What?
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
Well...
Hey, mack!
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
I don't make the rules.
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
Everybody still up on the Island?
Robert, I have to tell you something...
It's not that bad.
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
Where's Catherine?!
You're leaving?
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
You don't call that music, though.
Catherine...
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
Four or five years.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
What?
That's three games to none, Carl.
Come on, get moving, dammit!!
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
... which should exclude you from any objective discussion. But keep in mind, even the arts aren't free of aggressive content, nor the institution of marriage.
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.
Look at me.
Victor.
No.  What you do today?
You got a boyfriend?
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
Fa what?
Where you goin'?
C'mon.
You sure?
Your friend must be misinformed.
What?
Where you know Amanda from?
I know how ta get him back if you want.
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
That's Babar.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
No children?
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
Just relax.
Affirmative.
Thought so. What for?
You gonna nail the chief?
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Are you all right, Doctor?
I'm fine.
My associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  He's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record of it.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Good evening.
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
And what was that?
Right.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Where are you going?
Right.
I know.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
That's Brazil.
Because we can't.
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
I'm all ears.
Why don't you try suicide?
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
'Magic' today, huh?
My hero.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
I checked. There was no divorce.
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
Cabana one.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
I would, actually.
No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill.
This morning.
Uh, almost.
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
What's the spread on the game tonight?
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
I want something I can print!
What?  Who the hell are they?
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
I was upset.
I said, I ain't got you...
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Who?
My God, Mr. Fairlane, you look like the Fall of Saigon.
So you...
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
You're friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. The King of the Shock Jocks.  I'm, I'm shocked.
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
So what about this watch?
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
Contacts.
Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
Aha, just what I suspected!
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
How much?
Let's get serious...
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
Zuzu, wake up...
Ford, you were right!
Pretty smooth, huh?
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
Ouch.
I'm sorry...
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
Polo.
The case!
Let me go out like a man.
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
Well, hello, Ford.
Jazz, we're talking here.
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
It doesn't have to be like this?
I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
What about Don?
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
You're that guy, the private eye.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
Mr. Doyle.
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?
What?
What?
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
Tu sais j'ai réfléchi longuement à ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-même.  Tiens.
Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
I don't know.  Boca is scared. He's not strong enough.  He sees policemen in his soup.
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
Why not?
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
Policy man in Queens.
Where'd you get this fag shit?
For garbage?
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
So what?
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Yeah.
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Baltimore?
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
I'm off.
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Deleon.
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
Huh?
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Sun spot?
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
No, not yet.
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
What can we do?  You don't even know who this guy is.
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
Tell me something good, Chief.  Tell me about the future.
Yeah, I think so...
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
Go in where?
Another rough night, huh?  That it?
She makes ten.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
He ain't our guy, John.
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
You work too hard, John.
I try to be.
Who are you?
Hell-
Who the fuck is this?
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
Think you can figure it out?
Do you want a beer or not?
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
Will you come with me?
A hammock?
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
Is that so bad?
I don't know.
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
What happened that night?
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
You don't "have to."
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
What?
It's all over.
But what I get scared again?
Which is?
Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
What do you want?
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
That's very colorful, chief.
Steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
Randy, you dipshit!  Take these off!
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
Yeah.
Time to check out the waiters.
Right.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
But I thought...
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
Yes...
Rennie...
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
I didn't mean for you to go!
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
I opened thousands of brains.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
Asbestos lining.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
Where are you going?
Where is it?
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
Paisley Porter.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
Let's work on it.
Does it feel comfortable?
She's dying.
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
What?
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
This is how we've managed to last.
They'll lose because they're my team.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
I'll have whatever she's having.
That's always been my problem.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
Alma Wetzel.
This could be it!
It's me. Nicky.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
We must have been heroic.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
Let's not start that again.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
Why do you care?
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
Game six is history,pal.
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
And he has finer moments now and then.
Alla puttanesca.
Do you think he can do it?
He's a very sweet man.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Are you sure?
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.
What are you doing?
You mean Gandhi?
What'd he say?
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
Do you find me stubborn?
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
In England, I was a poor student but I --
Perhaps some tea?
I dined at the prison.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
Who's leading them?
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
Often.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
You okay, Jerome?
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
What are you talking about?
Come on--we're taking off.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Why have you done this?
Anything I've forgotten?
German, is that you?
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
You can wear lifts.
I was at home.
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
You're angry--
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
I'm not doing it.
You want to drive?
My license expired, let's get out of here.
I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair done... the girl was slow.
Yeah.
Just like old times?
That's not all of it.
It's all right.
Wait... give me a minute.
For exits off Main Street.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
Doc...
Why?
He must have.
There better be a guy with the
I can handle it.
There may be a hunting party.
That would be the first time.
When are you going to learn?
Where are you going?
I don't want to hear it.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
Oh, Jesus... how?
So what?
Who was it?
I don't know, airport I guess.
I really hope you have a nice trip.
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
What do you have in mind?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Then you do it.
Sure am.
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
What's the damage?
No choice. I had a visit from somebody.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
This is my brother's car.
I made a mistake.
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Everyhing go off all right?
She's nothing to do with me.
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
I want to talk to you later.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Why'd you see him so regular?
Once a week you like a gentleman?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
I work for him.
Was he?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
Nasty.
Is he coming here?
No. It's all right.
That must be interesting.
Where's that?
What?
It just would. He was always the same.
You work here, Keith?
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
Where would I find him?
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Pension him off.
Still got a sense of humour?
Scotch, please.
They do that up North.
Not suede boots!
What's that? A hundred?
All right. Two hundred.
What's that?
Polacks and deadbeats.
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
Mmm...
They did.
We're stuck with this...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It is.
Some contest board...
I...
And it's not right to the customers.
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
No.
You didn't?
You're going to steal the leads?
Is that what I said?
Yes.
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Me?
You went for it.
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Yes.
It is dead.
It's a waste of time.
They stole the phones.
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
Were the leads...
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
The cops?
Yes.  The cops.  No.
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
I was at home, where were you?
Was I?
...did they...
Would you excuse us, please...?
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Mr. Levene...?
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
...no...
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
I wish I could.
No.
Because I say so.
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
Why I don't...
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
How do you know I made it up?
How do you know I made it up?
Five thousand.  I kept half.
The check's no good?
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Shit.
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
Fuck you, Dave...
From the store.
"Always be closing..."
I own the property, my mother owns the property, I put her into it. I'm going to show you on the plats. You look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your time and if you still feel.
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Home cooking...
The monthly interview...?
You're sure?
Kenilworth...?
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
I don't know.  They said we have three days.  They said we have three days.
To change our minds.
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
I don't understand.
Yest...
I told you.
I'm...
I don't have the power.  I said it.
This.
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
Eight units.  Mountain View.
We haven't got a lead...
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
Your farewell to the troops?
They took some of the con...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
John...
Did you see my present for you?
Will you take me?
To do business.
I can help you.
I'm not hungry.
We have no money for a rug.
Who is the greatest man you can think of?
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party.
I don't want to stay here...
The child cannot harm you.
I understand...
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Fredo.  Where are you going?
We have time.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
I've always taken care of you.
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
We don't know that's true, he never said that.
Hello?
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
You're right.
...and the tape will be running.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
I had no idea...
Kay, I told you...
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Very impressive.
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there.
I want you to settle on their terms.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
Are we going to eat or what?
What if I say shove it?
Yes.
What makes you say that?
Of course.  I am married still.
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
And your name is --?
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
But it's just my face you want to draw.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
No.  I could have, though.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
You don't think of me that way, do you?
Sorry.  Not today.
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
Ah.  A philosopher.
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?
Not me.
You're talking through your hat now.
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
I suppose you'd like the top down.
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
Are you enjoying yourself?
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
So it is going to happen after all.
No.  It won't do.
Why?
I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
Where's Betty?
Then take the pills.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
Yes.  Perfectly.
So what do I do?
More your line.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
Which ones?  I bring them all.
Does the yardman come today?
Your father was a schoolmaster?
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
You're serious.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Of course.
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
What are you doing here?
Six years ...
What kind of job... ?
My version of "take this job and shove it..."
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best.  Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them...
Sound it out for me.
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
No...
Who is it -- ?
How'd it go?
I guess ...
Peugot convertible ...
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
What time of year?
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Whatcha got left ... ?
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
Kip -- ?
Cool. So you're living up North?
Yeah -
Something like that -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
The era when crime didn't pay --
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
I know ...
What are we gonna do -- ?
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
Mitch.
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
Six or seven...
No ... ?
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
I take out my slim-jim...
Slip it in ...
Let me worry about The Club ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
Is he still working here ?
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
Not really --
I don't want any more of that Shit.
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
Nods.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
Nods again.
Go inside. I'll be right there.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
So now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until I got things straightened out.
I got seared.
What?
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
You ready?
Yeah.
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
All right, then.
Who'd you call?
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
What?
No, I had to talk him down.
I guess so.
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
Chuck, let's go.
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
All right, are we gonna have a problem?
Seven.
Where is it touching you?
Which one's your building?
Of course.
Okay. How?
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
Yes.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Hello.
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
My kind of background?
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
I do.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
Why there?
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
There is somebody...
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
Nautilus?
Crayons?
Tell me what you really think.
What does?
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
No.
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
So Christ, call her up.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
My wife's dead.
Hence, the word remarried.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Yeah.
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
I guess.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
I been there. I played my hand.
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
--No, have you had any experience with that?
It's not your fault.
Don't fuck with me.
Which one did you take, Will?
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
See ya.
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
You know, nothing special.
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
When?
I guess so.
Yeah, I'm sure.
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
How 'bout you?
I didn't see nothin'.
Want to work?
That's not your affair. Name.
Joad.
Kids?
Yeah. On my way home now.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
She's settlin'.
I ain't gonna run.
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
Yeah.
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
Didn' you have no breakfast?
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?
Granma's dead.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
I could hide you, Tommy.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
Yes, sir.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
Oh... really?
Yeah...
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
Computer guy.
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
I just play my own collection.
How long has it been?
Where have I been?
Are you going to the reunion?
Well, there's not much to tell.
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
You look beautiful.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Like love?
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
How do you know?
You know where I live?
What else? Say more.
I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain.
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
Is that right?
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
Did you see Blank in there?
And not show it to me. Ever again.
They blame you for the compromise.
And they want me to make up for it.
It's fine.
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
Why not?
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
A jogger, huh?
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
Thanks.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
The point was to love each other.
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
Mom?
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
How long is this going to go on?
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
I don't believe this!
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
Then why do you want to leave?
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Did he mention it?
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
About what?
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
What did you say?
What?... Oh baby...
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
It's me.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
What did he say?
We're very lucky.
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
What was I saying?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
Good night.
About what?
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...
Was the trip okay?
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
Don't you go to school?
Can you drive?
You want to go down or stay along the river?
You want to watch some television?
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
What are you looking at, young man?
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
Listen to this bullshit.  "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
Yeah, cool.
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Who's that?
Yeah, mom?
I'm taking over a TV network.
Hmmm.
What did we learn in school today?
Crash Override.
What's this one eat?
I'm Crash Override.
It's too much machine for you.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
Name your stakes.
You're not gonna win.
And you have to smile.
Okay. I'll copy it.
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
What?
There they are!
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
Good.
Colonel who?
Never fear. I is here.
Joey, Joey...
Yo, what's up?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
Phreak?
A hacker planted the virus.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
Real charmer.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
When did you find this out?
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
Get up there Rachel!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Found it.
Got it Earl.
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
Rachel come on.
I don't want to look pushy.
Its not over yet.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
You look sharp. You understand?
I am. Ben Meeker.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
Its true, Sheriff.
When he makes that call.
Something?
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
How's it powered?
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Jamie! Get away!
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
You're going to be late!
Why didn't you wait for me?
What time?
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
He was watching me.
What's this big, big news?
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
Yes, you can.
I don't want to.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
Yeah.
Is that all you say?
I gotta go.
Anybody live here?
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
You have the wrong feeling.
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
There WAS.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
He'll barely be able to sit up.
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
I see.
...any sister talk?
Hi.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
Well, let's do it.
That's just --
Yeah.
Yeah.
It depends on what way you want to go.
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
You're joking.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
Right.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Well, are...are they big?
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
Yeah.
Oh, my goodness!
Hi.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Oh!
What do you expect me to say?
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Poor Hannah.
I know she must be a really passionate person.
No.
Is something wrong?
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Was I?
I don't know.
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
Are you angry with me?
I didn't say that.
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
Hi.  How's she doing?
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
Why should I be afraid?
How about something to eat?
Hmm?
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
Like what?!  What?
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
No.
Why?
So how are you?
Hi!  Hi!
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
Okay.
He's married...
I know, no--  I know.
Awwww...
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
Yeah.  Me, too.
Yeah.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
...in a really horrible way.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
Come on.
You're kidding me.
Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Oh!
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
When'd you get here?
Thanks.
Mickey?
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Why are you so upset?
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
We have to talk about <u>money</u>...
Some museum director disappeared.
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
Well.  Word gets around.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
Or, perhaps...
I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter.  As the Soul of Man.  Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
You're ready now.
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
M'I gonna see you tonight?
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
What, What, I can't hear you...
How was America?
What's up...?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
...are you alright, sir...?
Seen what, sir..?
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
No.  And...
The children...?
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
No. 
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
I have had many excellent meals there.
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
My scar is a war-wound.
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
I <u>sense</u>...  The faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "Hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?
We got KittyKat...
And you let her get away.
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
What is that that smells so wonderful.
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
Our Mister <u>Frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
What would you guess, Ardelia?
Fine, thank you, but
"Because we don't have any money."
...and then, we're going to <u>Greece</u>...
I know where he is.
And why should we believe you?
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
Thank you.
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
...no.
Yes.
What is your point?
...yes...?
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
Because?
My encounter.
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
What are you gonna do about it?
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."
I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off...
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...

Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.
Gee, thanks.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
I don't really like your friends either.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend.
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
Like a suicide thing?
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
Perrier water!
You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
Did not.
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
If you'll excuse me......
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
Any contestants worth mentioning?
You two....
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
 I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
Look, Mother!
I'm so happy to see you!
gives her a sympathetic look.
It doesn't matter.
Him.
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Your insight is enlightening.
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Since what?
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Hello I'm Dr...
What did you just say?
You could say that.
What?
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
What do you want?!
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
What's under that sheet...?
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
And give a deposition to the jUdge.
I got your bail continued.
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
Underbelly!
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
Is she... serious?  A half a million dollars?  In my behalf?
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
He's right.  It's unprofessional.
Said he's not an actor.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
You didn't?
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
You test each one thoroughly?
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
Okay.
Let's watch some TV.
Where are these toys of yours?
Oh, it's nothing.  No problem. I was really lucky to find this place.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
No, no, no, no.
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?
What happened?
I'm thirsty.
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
So you don't have anything concrete?
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
Here, take this out to the table.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Neil -- what --
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
How were we -- were we cool?
<u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
I thought we'd be happy here.
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
How large is your brood?
Are we gonna buy this house?
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Promise?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
What is it?
A few days ago.
Yes -- I think it is.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
I hear you.
The river.
That's all?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
Thank you, Thomas.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
That doesn't matter.
This cannot be.
Your life.
Huge.
You didn't answer my question.
That makes you uncomfortable?
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
What now?
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
It has to be.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
You get anything on Smith?
You think we should take that chance?
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
Who sent you?
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
Not if they're looking at something else.
What are you talking about?
I'm here.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
What?
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
I overheard him with the girl.
I don't know.
It won't be a problem.
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
You sure?
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
You gotta pee?
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
Just one question.  Please.
Louise?
She didn't answer.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
It's right in front of us.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
Can you open them?
Who is it?
Yes.
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
Paul!
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
Ten.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
What did they say?
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
And what will they do with these satellites?
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
Your police are at the gate?
I committed no war crimes.
) You cannot kill them all.
For supplies, you drive.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
That will take time.
Who did you call?
What do you want?
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
Your brother's here?
You could have asked for a favor.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
The president has been murdered.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Paul, don't let them die.
No, no.
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
Please do not talk like this.
Rutaganda's place?
Twelve are dead.
What do we do with all these people?
All. What do you mean all?
The staff, the guests.
There are soldiers.
Moses, Moses Seradungu.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
Oh dear.
Oh, for chrissake --
If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
Shit, Pritchett!!!
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
-- closed.
I'm better than that.
This is the best we're gonna do.
Run.
Then who are they?
-- just not always in the sexual sense.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
And then what happens?
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
House 2, Guests 0.
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Problem where? Looked good to me.
Rewind that.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to.
Believe me, we need to.
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
Blackburn's dead.
He must've unsealed the room!
Please.....anyone....help me?
For the love of God....please...?
-- I'm coming --
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
I don't understand.
Can I have this room daddy?
What's he doing daddy?
Why?
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
Oh come on...
What?
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
Whoa there...
Do you think I'm a fool?
We're not going.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
Thank you.
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
I know.  I know.  But it's just so ... neat, isn't it?  The first gig that isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's taken away from me.
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
Why are you so interested?
What?
I'm trying to quit.
Wait a minute.  He was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
A prize?  For what?
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
That's your definition of "Hard?"
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
You sound disappointed.
"We all had our quarrels and parted..."
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
Welcome back to Vinci.
How long were you in?
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
Wha--
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Oh Hudson...
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
I knew it!  I told you it was a fake.
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Yes.
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
Get away from there, convict!
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
Why George, you big softie...
If you do anything to my friend...
Snappy.
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
Hungry, anyway.
You're from Muncie?!
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
-- or lack thereof?
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
...Certain people are --
What a beautiful thought.
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
Hey! Where's that martini?!
Sez who?
Ya know, entry level!
I'm sure you do.
How long've you been down here?
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
This I know, Benny.
...Geez.
...It is?
Geez, I --
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
...Who let you in?
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
Well, I'm a college graduate --
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
You're fired.
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
Finally.
Ya don't say.
How's that, Sid?
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
Maybe he's wise.
What's this?
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
But, Mrs. Rand --
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
I like her already.
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
You didn't drive her mad.
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
I don't know -- I don't know--
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
What do you think?
I'm, uh, going to bed.
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
I... I think I am...
You crying?
The turkey in?
What's on your mind? Don't --
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
Hi dad.
I'm fine dad.
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
Sure dad.
It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --
Good-night dad.
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
Your toes cold?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
What?
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
It's what?
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
Now you are being rude.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Major.
It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
How do you know this shit?
Mikey?
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
Can I come?
Hood residence.
Charles, what time is it?
I have to go to the bathroom.
What are you doing?
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
Yeah.
We -- we have to go to the guest room. We can't stay in here. What if Mikey? My parents?
One more shot?
Yes, sir.
What's the D.A. got them on?
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
You did your homework, Officer.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
Who's that?
She your only sibling?
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
He would have liked that.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
That's right.
Are you sure about that?
That's right.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
You heard me that time.
What kind of stuff?
You and Kay were like sisters?
No...
I suppose.
You gave her gifts.
Told you I could write an ending.
What the hell do you know?
I told you that was an accident!
Don't you pull that shit with me.
Yes.  Like that.
No back-up.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Who made us what we are?
She is.
Did you kill this vampire who made you both? Is that why you won't say his name? Santiago thinks you did.
Are these not the answers you came for?
Yes... My God...
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
Is that supposed to frighten me?
I want more.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
This is no performance.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
Give it to me!!!
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
Lestat - finish this -
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
She's here, your wounded one.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
How did you do that?
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
But why did you tell her?
Did he die in the fire?
But it has. There is no more to tell.
It's over, I'm telling you...
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
Yes.
I thought you were out of town!
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
No means yes.
Oh!
No way.
No.
Karla!
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
There's no way to lock it.
You're okay. Thank god.
Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Ray, we're just friend.
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
The shower again?
I'm sorry.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
Why are you doing this to me?
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
To a great weekend --
He leave you?
What's going on?
Cool.
How's the water?
We'll only be a second, okay?
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
) You feel the symptoms?
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -—or just because he is one's father?
What would I be thinking?
Yes?
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
This girl --
You know that sound, Oliver?
I've seen men die drunk —- and I've seen men die of the plague.
The General threatened me.
Why in the world can't you?
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.
Then foreclose!
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
By letting me help you.
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
What did you say?
Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow –– you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
No.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Oh, well, I can't . . .
I want you to take a good look at that face.
Who is it?
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
What's that book you've got there?
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
Hey, Ernie!
Is this the place?
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Today, over at the house.
Well, what happened to you?
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Oh, George!
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
You want a martini?
Okay –– all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
Those Rockefellers!
Pop!
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
Yes, sir.
Well, what about all your other friends?
Neither am I.
Well, why don't you say it?
Eighteen.
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
George Bailey lassos stork.
Yeah, just started.
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?
Your dad must be really pissed.
We better go back in.
Putz -- that won't be for hours.
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
The lighthouse?
Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?
Listen to Andy, Sean.
It's still there!
Aren't you off-duty?
We got a helluva tide this month.
In here.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
Where to?
Hey, come on....
Dad, I'm sorry....
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Where's my day book?
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
Careful.  What's wrong?
No.
All summer?
I know what you're going to say.
It was bad, wasn't it.
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
What'd I say?
That you were fired.
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
I know you did....
I'll give notice.
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Bullshit.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
Where the hell is Air One?
Is that me?
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
Now I really want to see it.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
That's a crock of shit.
Anyone know what time it is?
Shut up.
What's that mean?
Come on back up here!
Nope.
Power line.
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
What's wrong?
If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
When are we going out?  You and me?
I want to go with you!
It hasn't adjusted.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
Yeah.  Down there.
No.
Hope I make it through both.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
I talked you into this?
You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
Michael...
Don't think about it.  It's over.
What's that?
Kathryn...
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.
You don't.
Okay.
... Mean through the tubes?
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Honey, what is it?
I have to get out of here.
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
How is he?
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
How's sleeping beauty?
So do I.  But for different reasons.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
They still seem nervous.
Sure.  No problem.
How you doing, Kelly?
It's okay, Sean.
The space shuttle has landed!
What're you doing later?
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
What?
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
That?
Yeah, poor bastard.
Hey, I don't want to hear.
The world's southern most reaches.
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
That's impossible.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
You'll spoil her.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
It sure is good to be home....
We need milk....
No fair, I'm not armed.
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
At least he doesn't have a beard....
I see what you're doing....
Are you all right?
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
In a minute....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
I almost forgot....
Sit down, Ma....
I'll be all right, Michael.
Nothing out of the ordinary....
You could teach...You could....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
Why'd you come out here?
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Promise me....
Sure you can....
How do you like flying?
Our little island seems to agree with you....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
Yeah....
Inch by inch....
Feathers all over the place....
You didn't stick them on right....
They won't fight with me....
Maybe I missed you too....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
Where is everybody?
When I signed on....
Bring her to starboard.
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
Jake.
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
The van?
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
Maybe?
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
Someone bet me a dollar ..
No, you didn't.
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Where's your watch?
I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
Have you got a match on the bullet?
No, Sir.
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
Is this normal?
Did he get you the job?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Yeah, in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night, night, Freddy T .. John ..
You must have some idea about him.
Can I see your hands?
Are you married?
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
You said, you were in the bad lands?
I know.
Why does he want to kill me?
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
You got a warrant for this?
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
You think John would like it?
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
So tonight she confesses?
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
He has? .. What's he doing here?
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
I just heard.
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Didn't hear it.
Oh Jerry.
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
That took guts.
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Maybe you should call her.
Well -- this would be goodnight.
Oh God.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
What --
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
What --
Tell me -- let me help --
I don't know --
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
That's the girl I love.
Forgot your keys --
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
Please, if I start talking --
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
You are not allowed to act this way.
No, I air-dry.
Forget it.  Forget it.
The kid is amazing.
We can still take the offer, Rod.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
Damn right.
Jerry!  You made it --
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
No.
He should have kept his head tucked down.
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
You hate to swim.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
What?
That's him. That’s Eric!
Eric! Are you here?
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
PAUL!
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Is it a rex?
It looks intact.
ALAN!
NO!
He used to know me.
Good luck with the fund raising.
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
We need to head for the coast.
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
Bonitas.
Amanda!
How do you mean?
What?
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
John . . .
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
What's he got in there?
She's gutty.
Then this is our chance.
Our chance to do what?
It has a broken leg!
No.
Come on!
Something's wrong.
So that others would know about this place?
Why should they?
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
Hold it down, Nick!
Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
Find Nedry!  Check the vending machines!
You shouldn't use my name.
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
The taphonomy sure looks that way.
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
Okay, I'm on channel two.
Oh my God.  Aw, God.
No. We can't.
That's right.  Will break through.
It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
Alan?
Can we chance moving him?
Yes?
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
You got me.
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
You have no idea.
You got any kids?
Yeah, they hate me.
We gotta do something.
Hey, we were saving that!
Ah - - they're here.
Tim!  Lex!
He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
Jesus Christ!
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
Hello?
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
What's going on?
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
So?
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
-- I'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details.  -- To see such determination is reward enough for me.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
Will you do me a favor then?
Then its authority is in doubt.
I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
-- Eduard --
Why would you suppose so?
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
You almost married recently, didn't you?
What of it?
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
I don't know.
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
Do you?
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
What's the matter with you?
Still, we're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
All these in the last year?
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
It's ... lovely.
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... · organize an expedition -
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
What?
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
Are you gonna start it up?
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
Mm.
Do you always have to repeat?
No.
Look -- could I use your phone?
Well we're pretty --
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
Like for you to look for the man.
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
Oh no, I don't think --
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
He never told me.
Did you like my friend Frankie?
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
No.
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
Mm.
Yeah.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
You're going back?
You wanted to, or you are?
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
You must be discouraged.
That who?
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Well --
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
I wanted to give it to you first.
I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
-- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
Wow!  French toast, really?
You forgot the milk.
Will she pick me up after school?
Uh, huh...
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
Daddy?
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
See.  That's my name.
It's my name too.
Mom--I mean, dad?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Was there Burger King?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Objection!
And would you describe those years as happy?
Yes.  Very much.
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
I don't recall.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
I'm not taking him with me.
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
I don't know, Jim...
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
Ted?  Are you there?
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Hostile?  Me?  Thelma, I'm not hostile.  I am anything but hostile.  But if you want to know what I am.  I'll tell you what I am. What I am is, I am hurt.  I am very hurt.  And I just want to know one thing, okay?  Just one thing ...Why?  That's all I want to know...Why?
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
How many onions does it say to use?
Where are you from?
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
Here. We'll collect them.
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Can India help us?
Britain?
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
They will take Lhasa next.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
Me?
True.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
I will miss you.
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
Too young?
Thank you.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
Cocktail?
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
Then do it!!
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
I'm not making it up.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
You okay?  Kelly?
Who taught you be be a nurse?
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
No.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
I'll take it!
I wouldn't.
Seconds.  Three, four.
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
You think Jack's handsome?
Are you alright?
What?
Did you get him?
That's not what you came to say.
A jerk.
A tooth?
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
No.
Boy, is that smart...
I don't know! Get me out!!
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Miggs has been murdered.
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
You knew. You knew from the start that Lecter held the key to this... But you weren't up front with me. You sent me in to him naked.
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
Then please - do this test for me.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
I don't know. Is it?
Was it a butterfly?
Killed outright?
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
No.
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
He kills w-
I heard a strange sound...
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
Yes... I did.
We leave in the morning?!
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
We were headed...
Who were these people?
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
I don't understand!
And if we're unlucky?
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands...
Will you men help us stop the French?
Webb's at Edward?
Sergeant! Form three ranks!
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
Gifts?
Wampum?
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Yes.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
Granted.
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
What's wrong?
He did.
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
We're getting out of here just in time.
Can you fix it?
We're on backup air.
The internal monitors read normal.
Something wrong, Cobb?
Excuse me, sir...
Thank you, Martin.
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
What the?...
So that's all you do?...
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
Getting some food.
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
Are you sure you saw something?
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
Bacon, see what we got.
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
There were two old guns there; where are they?
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Mind your language in front of my boy.
You all right back there, mate?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
Is he on his own?
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?

Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
There is only three of us here.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
That's it all done, we are off.
What do you mean?
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
How many feet?
Er, fertilizer.
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
So?
How do you think you're going to make a living?
I can fix cars.
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
Yes, sir--
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
How do you think I got to be a colonel?
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
I hear they're closing that post down.
Charley Wade.
Yeah.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
You're fired. You're outta the department.
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Uncle Al--
Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
Same as they done in Mexico.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
You wouldn't?
This place is a gold mine.
Right.
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
Maybe.
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
Seriously.
We been through this before--
You could take it--
Treasure hunter?
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
You get much of that in here?
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
And people make their choice--
Protection?
Como se llama? [What's your name?]
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
We have a daughter.
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
"Mas cerveza por favor."
We don't need a new jail.
That's a matter of interpretation--
Right.
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
I haven't been out here for a while.
And the ten thousand?
We're building up tourism, Sam--
I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
Right. When he was killed.
Thank you.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
He had the club out on the old trail road--
Okay? He's not here?
I don't think you can take it personally--
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
What's she singing about?
It was for personal consumption.
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
Field trip?
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
No--
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
So what are we gonna do about this?
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
Yeah--
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
They got telephones.
You'd do a good job.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
You don't need to cuff me.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
Yeah?
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
My life was too weird for her.
You did.  Didn't you?
Why would I do that?
Who did this?
What do you mean, "all of us?"
About?
What is he?
What's the connection?
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
Quaid and Jennifer--
Is it finished?
Valentin?
... they believe you.
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
Go away.
I saw him in Vegas once.
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
I can't let you in.
Leave her alone --
Yes.
I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
You know Vinovich?
Have you been in?
Look, Ma, no wires.
I don't know what else to do.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
Nobody's better off this wav!
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Is he the Puritan?
You could still help me do that.
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
Oh.
Oh, hi.
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob — Charlie Brown.
I don't want to go home.
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
No, I was looking at you.
You're possessive.
Yeah? But look at you.
And marriage, does that get easier?
That's too scary.
You made it.
Well... have a good flight.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
I don't think so.
Hello, darling.
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
Hi, Lydia.
Is this a bad time?
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
Is there anything I can do?
Hello?
Tomorrow.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
You smell weird.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Are you sure you want to stay?
I miss you.
Lauren?
You never said anything to me...
Bad?
Uh...sure...I...what?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
You just call?
May I help you?
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
I'll bet.
Nothing yet.
Get up!!
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
What do you mean?
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
You know what?  You can go.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
I hate it.
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
What?
Yeah, you met her?
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
So you're still breast-feeding?
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
Uh-huh.
Wait...
Damn, girl.
To do what you love.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
Mom tell you to do this?
You lost your head.
What?
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
Thanks.
Just one word of advice for next season.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
I wouldn't know.
So...does it hurt?
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
I think we gotta kiss now.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
I don't.
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
You don't look half-bad.
He ain't Spalding.
Fine, Quincy.
Forget Tonya Randall.
Then prove her wrong.
So how about a little one-on-one?
She understands.
I...can't.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
he's just playing, Q...
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
I never asked you to choose.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
You visiting?
Like what?
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
What?
One game.  One-on-one.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
Zeke.
Yeah.
We were just studying.
Okay.
Still the man.
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
What?
Still is, so let yourself out.
What's wrong?
Hello?
Well can you connect me to someone else?
Does this sound weird?
It was scary though.
...what the fuck is this...?
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
GET THE FUCK OUT.
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
No.
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
Bit messy.
-- do you wanna cup?
It's not -- what's a 422?
You won't.  You won't have to.
Ok, ok. I'm back.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
I'm sorry, Claudia.
Really?
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
I've got troubles.
Not enough, what do you want?
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
Presence - with a double ass meaning gifts I bestow, with my riff, and my flow but you don't hear me though think fast, catch me, yo cause I throw what I know with a Resonance - fo'yo'trouble-ass fiend in weenin yo-self off the back of the shelf Jackass crackas, bodystackas dicktootin niggas, masturbatin' yo trigga butcha y'all just fake-ass niggas --
I'm almost done.
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
What happend?
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Do you have love in your heart?
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
You mind your own bussines.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
I paid you back.
Braces.
And how much is braces?
Give me your keys, Don.
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
All it takes is one second?
I'm gonna start rolling --
This isn't meant --
Mm. Hm.
Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.
Where are you from originally?
Do you have your masters?
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
He's in here.
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
You can't just come in here.
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
I preffer to stand.
I went out last night.
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Will you say my name?
Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
I won't.
Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
I'm drinking.
It'll take the pain away.
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
Who?
Did you ever touch her?
...Jimmy...
I really don't know.
You're her boyfriend?
Want me to wake her up?
Do you still have to do homework?
What's MOW?
Are you on drugs right now?
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
What does that mean?
Linda --
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
What would you like?
Ok.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
I didn't know the answer --
Are we gonna keep going with this game?
It's not right.
I have money to give you.
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
M'lady...?
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
Who is he, Aramis?
And people close to him, who --
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
There are more important things than tits.
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
Who?
"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
Betrothed?  I think not.
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
Phillippe!
You've... memorized...?
Magnificent valor...
Sire!  I -- How did you --
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
Yeah?
What do you think?
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
Let's roll -
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
Gotta come from somewhere...
Alright, where is she?
Anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone. But--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Are you alright?
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
No, but I'm listening.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
No -
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
I've got a better idea...
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
I'm not going anywhere!
Are you going to be alright?
Are you a regular there?
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
Where?
Read it.
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
Somebody hurt him?
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
As long as they're dead...
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
You said the guy down here is good.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
See? You do know something about him.
Wait, Will...
I'll pick you up in...
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
Wait for the back-up! Will?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
Tonic will be fine.
You worked out well.
That was nice of you to think of that.
I don't want to know.
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
You will tell the truth?
Absolutely,
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
In a holding cell.
She'll be in, in the morning...
Do you know something about that?
Most people are.
He's very strong physically.
He only bit women so far, right?
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
Hey, baby! Where are you?
At the store. You doin' some good?
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Blue, then.
What will you do?
I want to see you, too.
What's this Mama shit?
Go on to the house.
Will it keep them out?
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
You went in the apartment?
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
Stuart is fine.
Yes, I thought so.
I thought you would have some ideas.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
No.
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Yes.
George, I hate sitcoms.
You have to do it.
Andy?
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  "Here I come to save the day!"?  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!
What, you don't think I can beat him?
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
My hair is coming out.
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
B-but I have them.
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
How can you be so casual??!
GET OFF!
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"...
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
Bob Gorsky.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
Did you hear that?
There's something about him, isn't there?
Operator.
Just get me outta here.
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
You could say that.
The Matrix?
More important than what is when?
I know what you're trying to do --
I thought it wasn't real.
No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
Set down in there.
And she knows what?  Everything?
How does she know?
Yes.
What do you believe in?
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
Got it.
Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
What?
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
Yes.
Go!
Is Morpheus alive?
See who?
What do they want?
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
Which way?  Which way?
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
Waddaya think?
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
No...I'll be ok for a week.
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
No, she's got epilepsy.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Come on.
Well...no.
Just keep him quiet.
From the Korean War.
Of course.
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
Honey, please.
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
Yes, sir?
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
Yes.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
No, I don't --
In my sleep.
'Yes' to the deal?
Yes.
Is there any more to it?
No --
Shall we adjourn?
That's it?
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
But I didn't mean to do it!
I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
What you then?
Not time yet.
My Doctor Lady?
Don' need you okayin'.
Black.
And you're a nice man, Quince.
You love Allison, don't you?
You think so?  How do you know?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
I don't know.
I love your smell.
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
And is your heart beating strangely?
He's taking a nap.
I love you in an evening gown.
Don't.  That will come later.
That's it?
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
I won't.
Yes.
Excellent.  What is it?
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
Dinner?  Absolutely.
I guess...
You're violating the laws of the universe.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
Uh --
Yes?
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
Thanks.
No.
I guess you have your reasons.
You are --?
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
I want to have a look around before I take you.
'Take me'...?  Where?
I am, this is it.  B Day.
This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
Yeah, I give a shit.
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
How did you know?
Does Drew tell you everything?
Not my birthday again?
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
You're terrible.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Then what is it?
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
So you're a one-girl guy?
Not at all.
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
78.
66.
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
I'm sorry... um... ?
What's it like?
How long have I been here?
Seen you together, that's all.
This isn't my room?
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
Yeah, I remember you.
Take the money and walk away!
Yes.
Sleep okay?
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
And what did he say?
What's wrong?
Who?
Calm down.
Don't say another fucking word!
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
Beer, please.
Well, that's me.
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
Shut your mouth!
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
I don't think so.
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
What do you mean "bad news"?
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
Why?
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
You're not coming?
He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
No. You took them out.						  *
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
Just came in.  She's still alive.
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
The Keys?
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
No.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
Like...?
Good samba dancing...?
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Why?
Do I need it?
...in the morning.
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
Packaging?
Alonzo...
Stevens?
Anything?
To the limit.
No.
Where?
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
What's your take?
What are you talking about?
On the phone.
Where are you?
What flowers?
That sonofabitch!
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
I gotta, I gotta go...!
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
What for?
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
They wrong?
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
Hey -- whatsa matter?
Thanks, Joe.
Get outta my way.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
You really want to do business?
...He had a bald skull and...
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
Years?
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
DAD!
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
But just...
What they give you?
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
Then we're outside the kogus. Then what?
What?
Cut his fucking throat.
What?
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
That's a great philosophy.
Mr. Yesil.
Lawyers?
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
There's really people living down here?
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
What are you putting that crap on me for?
He didn't do it!
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
Thought it was my week for that.
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
I heard how you talked to him.
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
You go first. I'll be right below you.
Talk to me.
It bit you.
This wing configuration. I've never...
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
Sure.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
You're very kind...
When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing.
Nothing.
Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
I can take it, go ahead.
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
I DIDN'T...
You want me to burn my book?
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
The what?
What?
...have to wait.
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
To Misery.
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.
"There is a justice higher than that of man. I will be judged by Him."
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
What thing?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
Did they win?
All done, chief..
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
How're we doin', then?
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
Your help?  What are you talking about?
Awfully short notice..
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
So where did I got right?
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
There's nearly 2 million in London.
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
And that's the only reason?
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
'Terrorists?'
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
I don't think I can get her to do it.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
She sacrificed herself..
And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
..not in time to save him.
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
What kind of show.
Nothing but civilians, Gene.
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisíll have to be quicker than Iíd like. Certainly quicker than youíd like.
Now we donít have to eliminate him?  You like that, donít you Claire?  Donít you?
Krieger.
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
Did they send you...Did they send you?
We did what we had to do.
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
<u>Are you intact</u>?
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
On what?
Why, may I ask?
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
Higher.
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
What problem?
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
Where are you?
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
Jim...?
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
That's what we do isn't it?
Jack you're so wicked.
Try it again.
I have my eyes open.
You look tired.
He got hit by a bus.
I won't come.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
You haven't once said you like my dress.
Why didn't he call himself?
He's in Palermo.
Yes.
I'm going to marry him.
That's it.
Yes.
Me neither.
Take it easy.
I'm telling you you can't.
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
I'm here!
This is your place.
That's right.
I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?
Yeah.
Ronny!
Loretta, what are you talking about?
It's Johnny Cammareri.
On the floor?
How near is she to death?
Who is he?
He's my younger brother.
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
What?
And we'll sell the house.
Where you been?
Cosmo's cheating on me.
What the hell happened to you?
What? He's in Sicily!
WHAT!! She was dying!
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
Alright.
Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.
I came right from the airport.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
You're kidding?
Who was that?
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Yes?
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
Don't shit where you eat.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
Temperature's dropping.
I guess you can't invite me in?
Rita. Rita.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
Burn them.
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
You're using coconuts!
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
Oh!
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
What?
Well, what's that then?
What are you going to do. bleed on me?
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
Behind the rabbit?
Yes.
The nose?
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
He will be soon. He's very ill.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
What is your name?
What is your quest?
When's your next round?
Gosh - Is he all right?
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
But I don't like her.
But, Father.
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
Well ...
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
Hurry!
I done it again.
Sixty.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
Aye, but will they?
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
What's this?
Of course.
She's busy.
What did you say?
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
This is a slur on her good name.
Nobody has any rights over me.
I am a blank sheet.
Maybe, once.
Aye.
Why do you think I keep her here?
Too busy looking after themselves.
No loyalty.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
You are well?
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Yes, ma'am.
Those, over there, there.
We took a nip of whiskey.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
I'm breaking no promises!
Should we take it seriously?
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
Mrs Brown.
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
I understand he was in a fight.
A few days, ma'am.
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
How do you do that?
Has anyone seen Greg?
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
It turned itself back on, Nick.
No way.
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
We can't...
...but then it hits the relay stations...
SLIP-STREAM.
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
Shit...
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
What's going on, Cynthia?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
Someone's shut off my money!
What do you mean "you know"?
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
You gotta be kidding?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
Well, I ...
I...
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
Very pleased to meet you.
Just tell me where it hurts, baby.
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Can you tell me what happened?
No ..........I.
What is it Rita?
What's wrong?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
I don't think...
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
Nice wallets.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Not here...no thanks.
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
First Bank ? But how ?
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
Do you know where you're going ?
Yeah a real shame.
Is it over ?
That's not to tough.
You okay ?
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
Don't.
Don't eat at the console.
Hand me the 3/8ths.
When will that be ?
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Well ?
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
How long till the drug wears off ?
Bruce has just awaken.
What is Bruce doing ?
Was that the Old Man ?
<<belch>>
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
This is California, anything is possible.
THANK YOU.
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
I already bought a ticket.
What??
Hi Dad.
Hi honey.
She just had a baby that's all.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
I told you it was a long story.
Do you have any pictures if her?
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.
Hi.
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
Yeah, RIGHT.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
Where are you going???
It's dangerous!!
You mean,  this ring?
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.
I don't think the color of the interior is....
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
A secret, I like that.
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
There's plenty of fruit.
You know how I feel about you.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Is there milk in them already?
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
Vada!!
Of what??
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?
Can't you see it?
Stiffs??
Deceased.
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
No, why?
What happened to her?
This is where we are.
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
I love this guy! 
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
When?
I like the freak show.
Hi Vada.
What are you doing.
He was allergic to bees.
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
Are you sure about all this?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
No....
Why do you think she says that?
Really?
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
My Dad was funny?
My ball, I lost my ball.
I would.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
I won, I won!!!
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I think it should be outlawed.
Thomas J?
Uh huh.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Hmmmm, interesting.
Is that your Dad?
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
Sorry.
Pacifist!
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
You're right, let's knock it down.
Run faster they're after us!!
But I have my clothes on!
I wanna live with them too.
Get up!?
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Uh huh.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
Blood oath.
He can't do that to me!
You have a real philosophy of life.
I was devastated.
I give.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
Needing.
I did what I came to do.
But I can't be dry.
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
And the answer was so simple.
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
Exactly.
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
I think he's been fired.
And you think he's kept this to himself.
Maybe.  I should call Ben.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Quite the little eccentric.
I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
Takes me back.
No accents today.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
The fax is from Ben, too.  Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
This is her family and her fault.
Lower.
Because I could come...
And to m...
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
You got a real good memory, Star.
What?
Grand Old Opera --
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
What's wrong honey.
Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
Am I disturbing you?
I said, I've been real tired.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
You bet.
His Word.
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
Who the hell is he?
Third party?
Howdy.
Come on. He's a crook.
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
She's in Paris.
You bet.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Your brother?
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Yes, sir.
I didn't think it would. She's calling herself L.A. Joan this- week. Last week it was Dakota. Guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
Uh huh.
Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
No.
Mom?
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
Does their hair fall out?
Listen. Maybe I should go...
Have your children been deaf since birth?
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
Hello.
Linnea?
I'd really like to see you.
I can't.
How old are you?
Well...
Oh.
Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
That's unkind.
Oh.
Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
Sleeping.
Hi.
Pleasure
What do you think of him?
You go to school together?
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
He ain't really new.
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Ah... Peter Finch.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
What kind of pies do you have?
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?
What did you think then?
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
Naw, she don't mind.
Yeah.
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
Do you miss Mallory?
Then was it worth it?
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Tell me about the purity.
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
Sure.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
Hypnotizing.
And a snake-eye glare.
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
It's hard to say Capt'n.
Take a wild stab!
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
What's the travelling arrangements?
Wayne Gayle.
What the hell happened to you?
How 'bout Mallory?
Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.
How's it working, Scotty?
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
Yeah.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
Okay.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
You work around town?
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
My father's the preacher.
No.
How d'you mean?
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
Why did you?
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
Goin' to see my kid.
I didn't know you had one.
I'll have some coffee, please.
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
They won't.
You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
No point fixin' it!
What you gettin' all pretty for?
How 'bout the key?
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
Wouldn't have known you.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
How you doin', boy?
That's right.
They'll run you out.
No, they won't.
Hello.
Guess it's never been easy.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Don't look like there's a right way.
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
No. Why?
Let's go.
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
Since when?
Let me get you another glass of wine.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
Can you get us into Straylight?
What the hell is that?
Ghost a steppin' razor...
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
You're pleasant tonight.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
She's ready to go.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
How's the ice break?
You haven't got it?
Wait... You hear that?
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
Maybe something's onto him.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
I don't sleep much. You packed?
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
How long will they watch us for?
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
It is?
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
Guess who I did it with last night...
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Cuuuute!
Hi!
What is this?
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Hey--what are you thinking about?
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Better than I...
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
When are you going to open your eyes?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
We'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
You got your room straightened out yet?
I know what's wrong with the air coditioning - just needs a shot of freon, is all.
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
What are you talking about?
Jesse, help!
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
You two got a thing going, or what?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
It was okay.
You mean a shithead.
I figured you might like some help.
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
C'mon, cut it out.
About not finding any bogey men?
What is it?
I'm not hungry.
Maybe we should call a doctor.
What's that?
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
Did she always have nightmares?
I'm sure you would.
Jennifer --
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
That was different.
Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
I don't know...
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Well, if it isn't my little girl... come to visit her Daddy.
Anything?
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
Oh God.
Ms. Thompson.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
Didn't get much sleep.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
So do I.
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
Somebody else is out here.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
Freddy.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
Hi.
Lovely to meet you.
Now you're lying.
And then I... right.
Really?
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
No.
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
Here we go.
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
That's fine.
I thought you were leaving.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
With a goat playing a violin.
No.  What's that?
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
That's spectacularly unfair.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Hi.
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
Da Vinci?
What happened?
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
Still, not sparkling.
Ah... yes, enormously.
I suppose so.
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Any more announcements?
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Which was?
And she's in your house.
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
What book?
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
What for?
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
What is it, kid?
C-C-C-C-Candy!
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Yeah...
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
Let me get on your shoulders.
They must be up there!
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
Ya know what, Fred?
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
You can come back later!
Who told you that?
Hit me.
Yeah, Mac?
Gimme the ball!
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
Doc, what can I tell ya?
Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
Yeah, buddy?
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
I'm the next one.
Because I quit breathing.
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
Somebody's coming!
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
Big man!
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
Is everything all right?
I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
What?
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
He is your husband, no?
Of course not.
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
You...
Amazing.
I'm in love with you.
You're limping.
Yes.
You didn't answer my question.
Why not?
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
Tell me.
Right now?
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
What?...
What are you doing here?
You were saying...
Yeah.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
You aren't?
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
Really?...
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
I'll look forward to it.
Yes?
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
Only what?
You think he misses me at all?
'Course he does.
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
Oh my God.  Where?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
It was a ouija board, remember?
What if he doesn't like me?
My God... you're right.
Maybe I can change him.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
Kate.
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
I wish I knew.
But my own kid bro—
You said they was only going to talk to him.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
Working hard?
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
Mm—hmmm.
What the hell!!!
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night— we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready— remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens— This bum Wilson he gets the title shot— outdoors in the ballpark! – and what do I get— a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work— with all them muscles. 
Man, you were a mess!
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
That was nice of you.
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
How do you like it?
A dive? You mean, into the water?
What made you want to be a fighter?
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
You don't believe in anything, do you?
You're not sore at me?
I— I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And— I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
Edie— I— I— never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you— you're... .
Terry, what's wrong?
What I did to Joey.
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Charley.
Terry, for God's sake.
Your gun.
Nice fellows.
What do you think?
Raise a hand to me and... .
I told you lay off.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
You was a Golden Warrior.
No.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin'— take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros—  —away and you're a great big hunk of nothing—  Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Listen— Nolan—
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
The ropes are coming loose.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
A situation easily remedied.
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
You better hope there is.
Then why do you shake so?
Then it is some service you desire of us.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
They found the safe.
Shit.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
I'm going back inside.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
Leave it where it is.
Wait.  You not Adele?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
I'll need a last known address.
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
Good luck, Richard.
A little.
Boy, it stunk in there.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
I thought so, too.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
You don't act like it.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
We still talk, though.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
Really.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
I don't have a problem with it.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
Well, does it make sense to you?
To warn her about Chino.
You getting serious on me now?
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Of course not.
The fish?
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
Foley?  That you?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
Meaning time came, I left.
That time?
You don't remember me, do you?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
Me?
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
You're not my type.
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
Technically.  They're separated.
Not at all.
So?
It's possible.  Why?
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
Out for the evening?
Well, I need that...
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
Good shooting, Rafe!
Didn't you say test the limits?
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
So what are you saying?
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
You hear my okay?
Land of the free.
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
Yeah.
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
How's everything?
Don't get smart with me, son.
Win?
Danny's not coming?
You waited til tonight to tell me?
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
What's it going to be, Elizabeth? Seventy—five? Eighty?
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
Were taking you back to the nurse.
All right. What's the scoop?
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
That's disgusting!
Want me to drive you home later?
Looking good out there.
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Charlie. About last nights..
What am I going to do with you?
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
What about Janet?
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Terry! Slow down.
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
But I'm remembering the future.
It was Beth's idea.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author — fat, violent, drunk...
What're you doing here anyway?
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
For everyone.
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
What?
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Damn that Charlie I
All right. But this better be good.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -—how could you do that?
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
Who was that man?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
Don't eat the red ones.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
Hi, Richard.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
Just out.
All set?
He pissed me off.
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
Are we interrupting, Andy?
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
I don't know what to do, Bob.
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Aren't you giving an exam?
It could be parasites, an infection...
Drew!
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
Whatever.
Thanks for coming in.
About my blood work?
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
New baby?
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
Rayisha.
We're friends of Beckett's.
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
What have you prayed for?
I'll look over the Q and A.
I suppose you could say that.
I still am.
No. I didn't.
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.
Yes.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
Is that a question?
Leave that.
That's correct.
In a word, yes.
And I hate to rush you out of here, but...
How many do you know?
Who?
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
Fine, Joe.
Don't know, Joe.
Yeah... ?
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
How did you do that?
You taught him a lesson.
Yes, we did.
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
You did this? To yourself?
Why, what'd you hear?
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
Here. Make it easy on you.
How many bottles?
We just keep him locked up forever?
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
He used that?
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
For your own fear.
We're just burnin' light here.
We aren't completely stupid.
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
Some prophet guy?
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
Imam. Slow down.
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
What, it's broken?
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
What's so special about him?
Look -- she remembers.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Well, maybe they're not.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Huh?
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
We got off at the wrong stop.
I want her.
I think you're making a mistake.
One is in a museum!
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Then there is another jungle?
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
Sarge?
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
Youse a pig man. I hope Manny get dat laundry gig for' you do.
Where's he from?
Fuck this shit!
...don't feel like it either.
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
Must be somebody?
'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
Yes?
The brush-off, huh?
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
I think I'd like to dance.
How long would that take?
No, please.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Whatever you say.
I didn't say anything.
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
There wasn't any plane.
There's a lot of night left to live through.
Dance? Here?
I didn't notice him.
You don't know who he is?
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
Frozen.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
Magruder does.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
Yes, Miss.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
I don't want to talk.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
I can't answer that.
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
Name it.
Private eye?
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
What are your rates?
I go home and paint the kitchen.
You mentioned information.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
A thousand.
So you're not a cop.
How are your teeth getting along?
How's life treating you?
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
The only answer I have for you.
Mitchell was too drunk.
You asked me where it all came from.
Mr. Mitchell.
A little something on account perhaps?
That's not enough.
With what motive?
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
I've met her.
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
I think so.
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
I never saw it before.
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
I don't understand.
I'm interested in who handled it.
How about Magruder?
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
So-so.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
I told you she's just..
Yes.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
What went wrong?
Now first of all, tell us your name.
Penfield.  James Penfield.
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
And some of that.  Sorry.
What did you think of that Wadja film?
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
In your car
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
Let me see.
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
You're a piece of shit
Have you come to talk about me?
Suez.  1956.
So how is she?
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
Don't point it at James!
No.
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
Don't you gamble?
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
You gotta earn trust.
You do it... you first!
What's this?
Talk.
I can't do this.
You never were...
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
That's the point, isn't it?
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
Got it.
They're on their way to Maui.
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
Shrimp and fries.
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
This gonna take long?
Catch of the day.
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
Look at you.
Those are cold.
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
What, Sergeant?
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
You don't know anything about me.
Yes.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
For an hour.
Get in.  This side.
You mean they don't have hookers.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Always.
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Good morning.
Where'd you go?
What are assets?
All right.  How much for the week?
Of course.  How much?
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
I'm sorry.
You still mad at'm?
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
Edward, I can't.
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
I know.  I'm glad.
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
Business.
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
I got tired of hating my father.
Aw, don't... no...
Vivian...
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
Edward, did you hear me?
We just did.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
Did I wake you?
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
Give me twenty minutes.
What!?
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
All this because of that whore!
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
Want a pair of boots?
You sure you won't come with me?
What is it, Miss Vivian?
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
You're not accompanying him to New York?
Would you like to try it on?
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
Then why bother curing me?
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
We did it.
What?
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
The Man in Black?
-- wait, just wait --
I don't understand.
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate.
Rise and report.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
I don't think I'm quite familiar with that phrase.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
And it is guarded by sixty men.
No --
-- all that I have and more please --
We'll wait until you're ready.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
There's something I ought to tell you.
Tell me.
Let me explain-
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
Congratulations.
What are you saying?
"Honeymoon,
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Well, sir, it seems ...
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
You're going to jump on me.
I'm not going to jump on you!
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Ohhhhhhhhh, how I hate you.
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
Yes.
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
I solemnly swear...
By the sacred memory...
The Graf Spee...
Heil you know who!
Vat?
What have you done, LSD?
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
I told them we invaded England.
You out to buy a motel?
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
Tell me all about her.
Very early. Dawn.
No one met her?
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
What difference does that...
Did he say anything about my sister?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
What thing?
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
I ought to call the police right now!
Where... can I stay?
Yes.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
Sorry.
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
I haven't even been married once yet!
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
I'd like to.
Uncommon, too.
What are you running away from?
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
Maybe you saw Mary!
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
Yes.
...Forty thousand dollars!
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
No mother.
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
You mean he doesn't work for you?
So--friendly or otherwise--?
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
Maybe you're right.
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
I'm going to call the police.
Yes!
Your father?
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
Yes, why?
What are you laughing at?
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
Well, I do say it.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
Thank you.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
What do you think I am?
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
No kiddin'?
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
That's what I said.
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
You weren't going with her?
What! And let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? Not so you could notice it! Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
I'm heading out of town.
Could you?
A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
I've been dreaming about this.
Is Rose here?
Where is she?
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
You were pretty bad, huh?
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Buddy, you're just a child.
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
Neither do I.
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
Well, it's not very plain.
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
Well... maybe...
The new girl is here.
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
She's watching the car again?
There goes Mother.
Let's go peep from the living room.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
They're discussing it.
Wow! Brrrother!
No, Mother, he's lying...
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Are they polar bears, too?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
Strange voices, Rose?
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Your baby?
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
Yeah, I'll do that, Dave.
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
Oh, Mother, cut it out.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
More history, Rose.
Yes, Ma'am.
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
Rose, you don't have to.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
And... ?
We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.
Kittle...
She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
Okay, we got... one, two... three...  Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
What's the plan?
The booze.
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
Smooth move, hot-shot.
Where we going?
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
Maybe.
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
It's our job.
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
Dead.
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
A.D. is a C.P.A.
It's one of a kind.
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
There's still good in him.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
Yoda spoke of another.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Fine. Together again, huh?
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
I don't know.  Fly casual.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
I...
Han! Chewie?
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Good, I hate long waits.
Here we go again.
All wings report in.
What do you remember?
If that is your destiny.
Yoda, I must know.
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
Janet.
Yes.
Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
Well I want to leave.
Right!
Great Heavens, that's a laser.
What guy
"Sweet Transvestite"
Was all I had to say
That ain't no crime
No no no no.
No no no no.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
...I don't know.
What's funny?
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
It's only temporary.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
They're all the same.
Would ya take off your glasses?
I always knew you was pretty.
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
...Like you?
I can't go out.
Why?
It's not your house --
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
One more round.
Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
Hear she's retarded.
Nine minutes!
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
Yo' yellow, old man.
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
How'd you know?
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Gonna try.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Why?
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
What?
Did ya win?
Spider Rice.
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
...No.
How do you mean?
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
Really think so?
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
I got pain an' experience too.
Whatta you get outta this?
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
God bless ya, Rock.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
...Sure.
I got whiskey here.
What?
You ballin' her?
To see ya train.
...People talk to me more.
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
So where is it then?
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Sounds like singin'.
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
Surprised?
You?
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Does it hurt?
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
You shot Roger.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Say, who's this guy laughin'?
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
Yeah?
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Good-morrow, cousin.
In love?
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Juliet!
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Ahhh!
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
Well, what was yours?
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
Nurse.
Do you really think so?
Why did you do that?
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?
Not me.  You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
Do you have the material?
Do you have it?
What do you mean?
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
Whoever hired us.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
Then where is it?
How so?
A means to an end, is that it?
Not exactly.
How did you know?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
You shoot alright.
Gets the job done.
Something like that...
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
Like Larry or Swede.
Deirdre?  Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
What's going on?
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
You think?
Business keeps you on the road?
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.
Not here.  They might see it.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
That's a good question.
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
Don't spend it all in one place.
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
Never heard of it.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
It won't work.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
You're crazy.
Not bad enough to kill him.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
It's gonna be o.k.
We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
That's right.
Uh huh.
Just take it in stride.
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
Nothing happened?
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
Great...
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
I love you Sally.
Why does that bother you?
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
I don't believe it.
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
What makes you say that?
Dwayne.
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Hello.
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
So be here at three.
Something wrong, Jesse?
What's this?
Dwayne put the gun down --
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
What?
Well you're not getting, either.
You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.
You're never getting that much.
Don't you want it?
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
No, sir.
Winner six!
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
Those girls drove off because of you.
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
What'd I say?
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
She said I could pick any girl I want.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
You.
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
You pull a muscle or something?
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
It's a long story.
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
Pick it up!
It's your turn!
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
I'm not used to having a partner.
Mind your own business.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
What is Mac out?
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
I did!
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
I know, Master, but...
What is your name?
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
And that, of course, would be me.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
No.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
What about them?
Yes, I know this song.
What a surprise!
They put you in charge?
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
You don't like it?
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
You a cop or something?
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
What is he up to now?
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
Right.
Yes.
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
"Sink the putt."
-- It's for you, Ike.
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
Maggie!
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
It's nice that they're still friends.
Thank you.
Getting nervous?
I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart...
I think so.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Can you fix it?
Of what?
Kind of isolated.
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
That's called changing your mind.
Yes I do!
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
And the church.
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
I'm going to kill myself.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
A harmless joke.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
You don't love me, is that it?
I hate boats.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
Am I what they had in mind?
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
Even when you were young?
Does it have wheat in it?
And then I'll see you in New York --
No.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
You couldn't.
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
What?
What's with you?
What?
Did you talk to him?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
You were standing in the middle of the street?
It's a sign --
You don't know who she was, Annie --
M.F.E.O.?
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
No, I'm not. 
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
Howard.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Mom, we already...
Grace heard it.
Why not?
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
You don't like the one he was now?
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
It's a spice rack.
Dad?  About last night?
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
Whose show was this on?
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
Did not.
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
No.
Hi.  Sam?
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
You're kidding --
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
Mornin'.
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
Got any more ideas?
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
What?
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
Can be what?
How do you feel?
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
A meeting?
Where are you going?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
But honey ...
Go on. Spill it.
Well, if that's possible ...
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
First rate, ain't it?
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
What?
It's not that easy.
Then leave.
What happened to your eye?
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
Like you?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
What are you hiding, Danny?
It's me.
You can still work.
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
They would have killed you too.
How you holding up?
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
How the hell did we get this detail?
You don't say.
I'm hurting.
Don't get carried away.
You want a hit?
Yes, Jimmy.
I can't tell you.
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
You don't understand.
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
You want to do this some other time?
Pull your pants down.
Just some buddies.
I was getting to it.
What the hell are you doing here?
Cut the shit, Flynne.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
That's because he doesn't have one.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Murder.  Beautiful.
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
We're in business.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
What is that? Rum and coke?
Resistance?
Yes, sir.
But, sir...I...I...
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
What do you think?
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
Yes, sir.  It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany.  Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent.
In the shadow by those two trees.
Not yet.
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
I heard.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
I wonder where they're going.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
But, sir...
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
You?  Leading a squad?
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
Hell of a mission.
Got it, sir.  We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights?
Nope.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
Bits and pieces.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
I don't like that one.
What if our guys open up, sir?
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
I usually like surprises.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
You think he really believed it?
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
How can you, how can you say that?
So you refuse to answer my questions?
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
No, no, don't go in there.
What's a scam?
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
I am.
He'd like to start serving immediately.
I'll put this past my boss
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
I'm sorry.
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
Morning honey.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Honey!
You think you know what this money is?
Yes, I...
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
Busy?
So you're monumentally busy?
Hmmm....
What are these?
Keymaster?
Then call me tomorrow.
Stop by later.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
This is so noble.
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
What's wrong?
We'll see.
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
No.
Did you tell anybody?
What do you want?
What?
One more time would be nice.
The truck?
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
Hello Lloyd.
Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
Very talented.
My car.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
All right, okay, let's talk.
This is not my problem.
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
What do I got for you?
Yeah, okay.
How many?
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
Pistols?
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
So I'll talk to him about it.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Jews, yeah.  Investors.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
Eight hundred, give or take.
They're withholding payment.
There will be generations because of what you did.
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
I would say we are now officially baffled.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
I'm losing you.
Someone who wants to talk to you.
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
I live here.
I had to change. Did anyone call?
It helped me realize one thing.
It’s over, Cotton.
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far.
Where is Sidney's father?
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
Finish what my son started.
She dumped me.
Why?
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
Where's Sid?
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
I know that.
Yeah?
You broke my heart.
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
Just in case...
Where are you?
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
It's good to see you involved.
What about rehearsal?
Who is that guy?
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
How many guys they have on you?
..harmonica style is okay.
Gale?
She's not here right now.
But...
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
I'll be right back.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
Jesus.  Hello?
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
What do you mean?
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
Nope.
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
I can see nothing's changed.
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Sid I can see you!
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
Someone stole Sid's file?
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
You're not a detective.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
Who's phone?
There a story in that building?
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Yeah.
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
Gale he's got Dewey!
It's Sarah.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
No.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Duh... that's quick.
Nope.
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
Jesus, SHIT!
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
Or even a good porno.
Are you serious?
You don't still think it was me?
Who is this?
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
What did you say?
I want to now who I'm talking to.
What do you want?
How do you know his name?
Please don't do this...
No...
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
No, not yet.
Does mom know?
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
That fish smelled strong.
Where is she?
Casey! Casey!
What? What?
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
I'm not here to fight.
Just stay back.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
Uh-huh.
Are you okay?
Can you knock?
...so call if you need me.
Have a good trip.
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
Jesus, this place is packed.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
Why are they doing this?
And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house.
And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
I bet he's pissed.
So you think my mom was a slut too?
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
For once, Stu, drop it.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
Give it to me.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
What?  What?
What do you mean?
Give me the gun.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
You know that's not true.
Spit it out.
I need to start getting the feel of it all, right?  Meet the people.
No one yet.
Good.
What about sports?
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
He's preaching.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
What?  Assessing fines?
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
How do you know all about this?
What are you going to say?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
We could use about fifty more men here.
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
Well... what the fuck, man?
Slut.
Are you absolutely certain?
It's a hard place.
You should look into private schools.
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
JOINT action?
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
That's what I said.
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
My name's Edwards...I'm looking for my niece...she was in that camp when you attacked...
That don't make 'em kin...
Oh...
Futterman?
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
No...She's not...
'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
Where?
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
We just have to make a new beginning.
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
What?
She was old.
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
You didn't tell her!
Twenty-three, to be exact.
Follow that boat!
You have the last act?
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
We will all be put in the clink.
Romeo
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
Words, words, words…once, I had the gift…I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones…for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery…but now
A goodly length in times past, but lately
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
There's never any
This time we take your boots off!
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
It is all locked safe in here
She is always Aphrodite.
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Who wrote that?
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
How will it?
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Romeo is…Italian. Always in and out of love.
Do you think?
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
Your mother, and your father
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
Oh my lady, my love!
You can bring them with a word.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
I am.
Even your play.
No, the morning rooster woke me.
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
You flatter, my lord.
I do not love you, my lord.
The Queen has consented?
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
I am going to church.
Take off your hat.
No, sir.
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
Your aunt?
Like a sickness and its cure together.
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
A theatre poet?
I was trying to educate you.
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
Come on, David.
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
So who's going to do it?
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
But not quite.
Is this necessary?
Can we talk about something?
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
Nothing.
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
But they know.
Yeah?
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
I don't know.
Yes.
Yes. It is, isn't it? We alllike it. And the room's nice too, don't you think?
Cameron.
Did you know --
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
No, Alex. It's, it's --
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
Stop nagging.
Hello. Hello.
Will you calm down.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
David?
Everything.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
What?
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
Yes, absolutely.
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
No.
Did he sound upset?
No. But he needs treatment.
Same as everyone else.
Diseases.
I don't know, I think...
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Do you think George is a fairy?
Lester.
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
I gotta talk to you.
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
No.
Shit.
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
I am not!
And you need money?
Yeah.
I've got heads here, Norman.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
I'm sure.
What's wrong?
It was after you, baby. After you.
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
What?
You know what I'm talking about.
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
Baby...
Yeah, baby...
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
-- this guy with Jill.
-- don't you want to --
Sammy's?
-- sure.
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Look about last night --
You're going to kill me.
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
Oh yeah?
Yeah?...
-- please, please forgive me...
-- why did you come in today?
-- took a bus.
Hi, George.
Here in the canyon.
George --
Fine. How are you?
I am?
Yeah.
Do you really mean that?
We live together now.
Of course I like children.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Yeah.
Okay, baby. Okay...
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
About what?
When is that?
Who?
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
-- well aren't you --
How many?
Did you?
What did you say?
George...
What did you say?
What're you here for?
But Mr. Norman said --
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
Oh yeah?
I know it, I know it.
Oh, hey...
I wanna hear it from you!
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
Yes I do.
What took you so long?
No.
A soap?
Who were you talking to?
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
What's that?
Shut the door, shut the door!
Oh yeah?
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
We don't think marriage is important.
Five times a day?
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
It's been so long I don't how long?
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Is he an enemy?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
You're kidding.
-- I'll get in the back --
No.
Everything okay, son?
Call me Les.
Dad?
Yes?
Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
Tony.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Okay...oh!
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Shall we go into the living room?
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
And, er... where are they now?
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
No, we don't mind.
Yes, I did.
He's still asleep.
Get him out of here?
As soon as possible.
Wendy give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
Yes?
can of itself be a problem.
I don't believe they did.
Well, obviously some people can be
It's amazing how much activity is going on today.
Lowe's car-?
Can I tell you kids something?
Sure, Uncle Al.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
What's that?
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
I don't get you.
Sure.
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
Yeah? Really?
What if I say no?
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
So have I, actually... I wish it could always be like this.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
What about crack?  You a user?
SING!
Good evening, Vincent.
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
Two days.  An hour or so.
Soprano or alto?
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
Three years.  A rookie.
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
I have to do this.  So I can become a nun.
Who are all these people?
Mary Clarence!
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
Your name?
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
Is this all the food I get?
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
I must go where I can be of use.
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
Really?  Lieutenant?
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
I think they'd understand.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Then one day they find you.
It's a bluff, Vince.
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
Sister Mary Patrick?
Is this like your old convent?
He's not like other guys.
Ice cream!
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
If we could speak alone.
I hit him square.
He is a behemoth.
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
They need guidance.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Maybe you should take this.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
I shall, gladly.
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
I manage fine alone.
Are you familiar with magnets?
Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
In test... what?
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
Why... why are you like this?
This is farewell.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
What was that?
I... I can't do this.
There was not much blood, was there?
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
I can't remember.
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.
All right then.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Just thought I'd check on Karl and see if everything's working out.
French-fried potaters.
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.
What?
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Don't tell me what to do.
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
No sir.
You like that Vaughan?
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
Why? Hi, Karl.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
What's you last name?
Why'd you live there?
Yeah.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
How do you know?
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
Who did you kill?
Were they bad people?
I thought they was.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
If you want me to.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
What do you mean?
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
Why not? It died?
A boy or girl?
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
You will? For sure?
Yeah.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
You don't want to give away all your books.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
I sure like the way he talks. It sounds like a race car motor idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
Yes sir.
Do they know about you?
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
Tolerable, I reckon.
You scared me.
Right now?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
That boy wants me to.
Did you knock on the door yet?
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
No, we have to get this story.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
Before they were married?
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
Where will he go?
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
And what about for you?
Huh?
What's the difference?
Yeah, I did.
It's yours?
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
So. Are we ready?
Every word.
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
It's for you.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
Open it.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Thanks for the tip.
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
And his parents?
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
No thank you.
And?
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
What do you want me to say?
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
Baby? And what baby is that?
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
In Manhattan?
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
How long have you been here?
Two or three nights.
Take good care of yourself, okay?
Appreciation for what?
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
Is it yours?
Yeah, it might be.
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble, don't you?  So how much does it come to?
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
How long you have this detail?
I did.  Boy.
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
Still lashed to the mast.
Maybe...?
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
You must think I like losing.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Okay, doll.
It's from Satchel Mouth at Table Seven.  This is from me to you, doll.
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
Thank you ever so.
You're welcome.
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
What happened?
Of course I am.
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
With me?
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
That's right.
I'm engaged.
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
Hey - these are real diamonds.
Not that, you idiot.
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
That's us.  I'm Daphne - and this is Josephine.
Good night, Sugar.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Yeah - Josephine.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
I guess she's not in here.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
How did those holes get there?
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
You don't say.
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
This is where I get off.
It doesn't matter.
I don't care.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
We'll adopt some.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
Because I got some plans -
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
Afford it?
Me?
That so?
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Brains aren't everything.
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
My fault.
Who are you?
Your face is familiar.
Your view of what?
Up, up, up.
For your own amusement?
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
- opening of the Opera -
- and always the same Four Hundred.
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
You collect shells?
The most wonderful thing happened -
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
You're flattering me.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
They just sort of leave me cold.
See?  Nothing.
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
Daphne -
I know.  Every time!
I come to the old lady's funeral.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
I never join nothin'.
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
You shave with your spats on?
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
Yes, sir.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Thanks, Charlie.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
Oh, shut up and be happy. It’s always this or that. You’re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
I don’t think I can go through with this.
Still--
Or Kat....
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
I had to say something to get you here.
No, tell me.
It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
That was a long time ago.
So, what’s your point?
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
You think we look like we’re trying too hard.
Why?
You stand on your tiptoes.
I have a friend at the magazine.
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
What?!
Subtle?
So you’re telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That’s a down payment on a Ford Focus!
What?
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It’s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you’re not walking away!
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You haven’t visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
Oh, no. He told you.
Yeah.
She’s drunk. -er than me. But I didn’t really dump you, did I?
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
He'll show up one day.
Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
You bet we is!
From Miss Johnson --
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
Who is they?
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.
Yes, mam...
So when I left, she gave me these books.
Be good and be smart, little boy.
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
I'll walk...
You know, one time by mistake I went into a white church down in Row County and to this day I don't know how'n the devil I got outta that church alive.
Any time it's Saturday and I don't hafta do any work, I'm doin' okay!
Whatcha got there?
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
Night, son!
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
Okay.
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
Your behind?
YOU DO?!
Look, Eric it's your little friends.
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
Mkay.
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
Thank God, that sucked ass.
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
Mrph mprph!!
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
What's the password?
SHIT!
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Nowhere.
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Yeah, so what do we say?
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
WHAT?
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
Huh?
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
How is the children's progress?
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
AGH!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
I know.
What if I just left?
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Excuse me?
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
I think I can handle it.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
Barnes?
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
It's time we lock coordinates.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
What are we going to do?
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Everyone just stay put.
Are you ready?
Do you want some advice?
Sure.
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
Dawn.  Come in.
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
Carlo!
I'm going back for Taylor!
What the hell is that?
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
I hate fuckin' opera.
But not no more. Now people take advantage. Bowling ain't what it used to be. There's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big, gigantic, puss- ridden -
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
What do you think I can do?
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
It's mine.
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
My poor baby!
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
Don't tell me, John.
Cool!
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
Someone wants to play with me?
Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Not while I'm in training.
Nothing.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
Come on, bargain with me.
You're here.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
It's Junior, isn't it.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
Are you sure he's dead?
You don't get two chances with Junior.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
Very professional.
Lips still for sale?
Get out of there!
What is it?
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
That's our reserve air.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
Extraordinary, isn't it?
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
I don't know.  That's the point.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
You don't want to know.
I think I do.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
It's not sucking, sir.
It's chipped.
I did.
Ted?  Captain?
So how do we get it open?
So?  What's the problem?
Gimme a report, I want --
What's the message?
Look at this.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
You did, didn't you?
Don't bother me, Norman.
You fixed my suit?
Still clear?
You get it straightened out?
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
Page 87.
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
But how?
I don't know.
Sintag.
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... "
How long does it last?
Not believing you.
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
Is it?
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
Beth!
Beth?
Beth -- gimme the gun.
Hear what?
Would it work?
For who?  The fish?
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
Why are you looking at me like that?
When did it come across?
You holding up alright?
C'mon.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
Beth left?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
Did I kill her?
C'mon, Norman!
Nine hundred feet to surface.
How's that working out, by the way?
There is one possibility.
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
You've heard of me?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted.
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
How can you store an energy field within you?
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
Yes, sir.
Blue Five, break off your cover attack.  It's too late.  Make your own run on the exhaust port.  Do you copy, Luke?
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
He was our teacher... He was great.
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
Your father will never let you.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
Profile's wrong... there.
WHERE IS IT ?
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
Funny...
Carmen...?
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
You can't walk me home.
Carl can wait.
None at all... We won.
Are you the boy for me ?
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
You don't look very happy to see me.
Should I be ?
That was just a mix up.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...!
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Sure.
No thanks, Diz.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
Man, they're defended... no way in.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Hey, Diz...
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Are your parents currently citizens ?
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Hi, mom.
Can you walk ?
Who is...'V'ger'...?
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
The Creator is that which created V'ger.
The examination is a normal function.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
They have repressed the Creator.
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
'To learn all that is learnable.'
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
Yes.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
<U>Computer off</U>!
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
Was he difficult?
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock...
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
You bringing your new friend?
He have any special dietary requirements...?
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
You quit.
Of course.
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
I <u>can</u>?
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
What happened?
What are you doing down there?
...lost the screw...
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
Oh <u>okay</u>.
You believe that?
What's the scene...
What've you got?
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
You know what else a man can do?
Now you're talking...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Not without a rolltop desk.
Lookit that, up already.
But that's what happened.
That a fact.  Now, is it a good play?
Courthouse back in town.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
They're holding it for ransom.
He's on the ph...
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
Whyn't you learn your lines?
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need...
<u>Bobby</u>...
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
I think he's moved...
Why?
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
That's my...
Yeah.
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?
Main Street.
Later for you, pal.
What's in the case?
I'm looking for the writer.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
I had a witness I would.
That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...
I can't find the writer.
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.
I have to tell the truth.
How do they know that, you told them?
I left that for you.
What's in all the bags?
<u>Pay</u> her.
We don't have the money.
Is that one hell of a kid?
She wasn't in...you were al...
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
...not at all...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
Ben!  What's wrong?
I'd rather be with Mommy.
I hate when you say that.
That happens.  To families.
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
Great.
He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
No they're not.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Poof!  You're happy now.
Yes.
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
That's Rache's song!
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Rache says it's from you.
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
We're not discussing your age.
Easy enough.
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
I'm afraid she's going to walk.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
She was angry at herself.
You feeling all right?
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
And I'm going to win.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
That's not wh...
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
You're lying.
You ride with Annabelle...
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
I trust you of course I do but --
But?  But what?
Not yet.
Rache, get out of th...
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
She's not gonna die.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Great to be here.
I'm still poor.
This is work.
He's dead.
Poison gas.
But really, you never know.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
We're not ready!
Don't even joke about that!
Yes, Mikey?
Marty...
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
Fine.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
I dunno.
Yeah?
Hi, Dad!
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
No.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Any books you like to read for fun?
No.
OK.
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
I do.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Yeah?
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
Well get someone down there!
I'll lead.
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
What now?
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
Are the labs in operation?
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Where does it lead?
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
Well?
What!
How goes the roll call?
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
Where are you trying to reach him?
At his office in the Capitol.
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Yes!
May I be stupid enough to inquire WHY IN HELL THE BASE COMMANDER OF THE 843d BOMB WING DID A THING LIKE THAT ???
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
Do you recognize my voice?
That's right, sir.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
You're damned right they are.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
Where, sir?
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
They're coming in now.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
Have you tried the recall again?
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
Then this is it.
War.
Check.
Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Primary arming switch.
What does it look like?
Some kind of signaling.
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
I've got one.
When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
He's dead.
He's dead, all right.
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
Recall what mistake?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
I don't get you, King.
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
Forget it.
But who would be chosen?
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
In Group?
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
Mm-hm.
Typical male.
Typical male.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
It's your birthday?
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
Erica is in the van back there.
Yeah, man.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Buff.
I'm so burnt-out.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Good. See you later.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Yeah, we're all above that.
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
Hi.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
A Porsche.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
Mm.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Who were you talking to?
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I don't need a limousine to know who I am, alright?
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
I don't know.
Man?
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
Okay, what would you have done.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Mm-hm.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
You do.
No. No, no, no.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
Go.
Hey, Pony.
Good, man.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Sorry.
Yeah, they could be songs.
Really?
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
Get off my property!
Look Pakeesa...
No, she was just sitting there?!
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
Soon.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
No car.
The fuck not?
Another sex dream?
Hi, Jack.
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
Yeah.
That was gas, Sweetie.
Hat-trick?
That you?
Yeah?
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
You want us to help you pick up?
Is that you down there?
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
My what?
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
More proof God's a guy...
You're going to stay, aren't you?
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
I tell you this is half sold.
We're engaged.
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Who's who?
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
May I say you smell real special.
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.
What happened?
If you love me, Joe.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
We've made a lot of pictures together.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
I wrote that with my heart.
What month?
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
I don't need a tuxedo.
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
Good.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
I went for a walk.
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
You made her a star?
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
No?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
This is the staircase of the palace.
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
It must be the girls. One of the girls.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
What do you want?
Wait...don't leave me in here...
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
I have to.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
I sort of like what you said.
Hi.
And now?
You vicious--
Do you have any theories about last night?
Can I give you a lift?
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
What are you making:
You see, a tree is a living thing.
I can do that.
How'd you do that?
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
Yeah? What do you want?
What are you talkin' about?
Mr. Roebush?
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
Too much mayonnaise?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
No, thanks.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
He really was!
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
Well...  Not quite like this.
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Wipe 'em out?
Turn on the T.V.
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
Is this blackmail?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Can you do that?
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
Turn on the light.
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Okay? Goodbye.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
Computers talk to other computers, right?
Today coffee----
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
Anybody been hurt?
So far the hostages are unharmed.
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
We'd better talk.
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
You're not selfish at all.
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
I like trees.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
Genius!  --  Lex.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Where?
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
Really Lois, we've got to stop meeting this --
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
Put down Lex Luthor !
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
I've never been in a place like this before.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
Maybe I should sit this one out.
Gee, I'm really sorry.
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
No Paris?
And what do we get out of it?
Impossible? Why?
Would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex.
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
You are . . .
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
I know, but  --
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
Nobody else.
I've been on the job.
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
Your bookie?
It wasn't a trick!
You're just jealous.
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
Listen...thank you.
You and your real estate.
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
What's the temperature now?
Krypton!
See?
You're happy, aren't you?
Ready?
You?! How about me?
You're not going to hit me?
She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
You got wax in your ears?
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
Two.
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
-- as we will be.
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
Lois, the kickback story...
You've got me? Who's got you???
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
What about it?
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I gave him this new face.
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
So there were others?
But you said...
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
Alison.
I will.
I hope she gets better.
Why are you telling me this?
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
They just finished supper.
Why?
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
I have to.
Because I have to.
Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
What do you mean?
That's right.
What do you mean?
You've talked to Billy?
Yes.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
No.  A little sugar though.
Is this mine?
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
I won't lie.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
Do you have a room?
Tell me about the Ottos.
Need a hand?
How old is she?
Perfect.
Here we go.
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
Yes.
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
Who are you?
You can't come here.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
Yes.
You think someone else caused the accident?
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
What do you remember about the accident?
You mean it?
It's okay.
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
Great.
What do you mean?
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
Is "he" inside?
But of course...
Did she accept?
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?
Is it news to you?
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...
No...
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Hello, Harry.
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.
How?
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
And who's feet is she on now?
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
What does that mean - integrity?
Could this be that boy?
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
And where was his wife?
Back?
He wants me to break a leg?
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
Frank, you don't listen!  J.J. just told you to shut your mouth!
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
Those lying motherfuckers!
It someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby".
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
Why do you cry?
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
So she's pretty cool, huh?
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
I love you, John.  I always have.
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
You broke my arm!
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
Why attack Russia?
Are you afraid?
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
I'm very sorry.
Some.
What the hell are they doing?
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
You bet.
and totally irrelevant.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
Yes.
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
Three months.
Major, Major... he's here ...
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
I don't buy that.
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
Your guess is as good as mine.
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
And what was that?
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
What telegram?
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Do you know what's in this archive?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Show you?
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
What?
He did?
And ask him about his private life.
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
They said I was dogged?
Yes, Chuck?
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
I hate the beige one.
What's it to ya?
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
So, it's from the future, is that right?
There's so much...
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Molecular-memory.
That's not my mission.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
Someone?
Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it.
Sarah.
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
Here's her driver's license.
That stuff's two hours cold.
Call her.
I just called.
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
I could fight you on this.
Alright... okay...
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
This is C.R.S.
Never did catch your name.
Seriously?  What did they say?
Is this you?
Take the picture out.
They're watching.
Wha... ?
That's a lie...
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
... what... ?
Stop talking to them!
Shut up!
That's not true...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
No...
No.
Hey there, Nickie.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Like a stroke?
I said I would...
Are you still on mediction?
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
How do you know?
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
I'll explain someday.
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
We provide whatever's lacking.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
You did?  How is he?
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
You know you can.
Just what I told you.
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
It's a question.
You could have.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
It's still an electric shock!
Why are you working with her? Mary Lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a Ph.D. in psychic studies.
No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
You know what he's really upset about?
How'd I know it was for you?
Have either of you seen David Watts?
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Is there something about the house?
Why?
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
Jeez.
Yes.  I've missed it.
What's his first name?
I don't know what to think anymore.
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
Is that a problem?
Not for you, clearly.
Anything but Japanese.
Italian?
We think?
Hey.
How they goin', kid?
This is un-fucking professional.
What kind?
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
You should have let me do the talking.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
You broke last time.
I wouldn't talk.
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that.
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
What are we standing on?
Steady on.
He's gotta know why.
What post office?
Same.
Probably.
You just cooking then?
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
That's what was estimated.
Right.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
Not that I recall.
I guess you're just habitual.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
Up the coast.
What's in Big Sur?
Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
Of the deal, man.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
What?
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
Exercising my visitation rights.
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Ah.
...Yes?
Ann--
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
...You don't like the music out there?
He was deaf when he wrote this.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
I don't understand.
Uh--
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...
Cash.
Yeah.
That'll be fine.
Uh-huh.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Your place?
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
Honey...
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
I took Doris's keys.
So... who... who actually--
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
Jesus...
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Huh?
Doesn't bother me.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
You'll go to the prison hospital.
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
Why not?
Forget it!
Battery's dead.  Shit.
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
What doors?
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
I think I should come with you.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
Curious.  There's something missing.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
What are they?
Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
How many storage areas are there?
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
We're not supposed to go back there.
What?
That's impossible.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
What kind of egg is it?
How about lunch?
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
How did you know that?
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
What happened?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
What happened?
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
Wounded?
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
I think... it means it's full.
Then it won't go after the others?
You smell that?
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
Where exactly?
It's the busy season.
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
Nothing was real.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
You think she'd go through with it?
Sure she would.
Now.
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
What're we doing here, Truman?
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
And then what, Truman?  We'd be back to where we were five years ago.  You're talking like a teenager.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
How do you know?
What do I do?
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
--we need more charcoal.
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
Well, I made it through another night.
They're coming.  Any minute.
Not supposed to talk about it.
We don't even know you.
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Incinerate it. Like the others.
Who called this meeting?
Who?
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
Have you examined them?
How's that?
You follow me out here for a reason?
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
You told me you had answers.
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
I'm on the roof.
Did you find something?
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
All I told them was the truth.
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
I don't know.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
Just like that --
On whose orders?
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
A virus?
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
What do you mean, walked?
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
What about you?
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
More concerns than that?
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
He hates me.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
Is it cold in here?
It doesn't have much to do with science.
Peter, okay?
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
Evil.
I heard Julia and John got married.
Well look at that.
No problem.
I need you to find something in the basement...
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Someone looking after her little girl?
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
What else do we do?!
I don't have to.
Right here.
Den leuten.
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
I don't know. They didn't answer.
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.
Tell me more.
It's just what he used to say.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
I'm so sorry.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
His.
...anyway?
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
That's what we want to find out.
I don't want it.
What is it?
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
Getting around, Martins.
Miss Schmidt.
So would I.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Which side of the road?
It wouldn't work.
Calloway!
What time is it?
They wouldn't know me.
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
Goodness, that's awkward.
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
And - Anna...
Why not?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
You told them, didn't you?
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
You really liked it?
Martins.
Could he have been at all conscious?
Baron Kurtz.
You saw it?
Kurtz.
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Yes, it is.
...Mr. Martins?
Passport, please.
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Help you out?
I'll share something with you.
Nice work.
One or two kilometers.
Why?
Big?
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
Bonsoir.
Did you sleep well?
No.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
How come you know all this shit?
I have a job.
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
No.
I want to learn to read it.
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
Why not?
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
That's a much easier game.
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
They're liars and cowards.
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
Why?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
I always won.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
But I wasn't.
From the Rhineland originally.
So what Jew would you kill first?
Hello...?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Get out of here....
Who even knew?
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
Why me?
I can tell....
You can't say that....
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Checking out the competition.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
Why?
How did it happen?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
Dollars.
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
Not at all!
Madame...
... Everything.
As I said, second of all you're too skinny.  You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
He doesn't like us.
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
A drink to warm up?
Tea... or whiskey?
No... tell me.
... Are you sure?
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Why don't you ask me?
What?
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
What?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
Any sign of Santa?
Want to get a drink?
Yes Esther.
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
I don't know.
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Why?
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
To the eye? Like other men.
Couldn't you tell a man like that when you saw him?
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
I thought they came right past here ——
What are you getting at?
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
On his back, I suppose.
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
When will they be back?
You wouldn’t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
Now you know why you’re here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
I won’t comment on the time but you’ll understand if I don’t tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 
I don’t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Get out of my house. You’re fired, Mr Lombard.
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
Who is Friedman?
You’re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
What do you mean, ‘No’, Mrs De Moraes?
Leon hung himself...
Is there anything to understand?
You bastard...
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Here we go again.
Don’t you believe in simplicity?
You seem to know what you’re talking about.
So you did talk about it, huh?
Why the hell couldn’t you divorce the man?
Europe...  France. I’m French but I live in London...  ... England.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
A criminal?
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There’s a dirt track with a ‘Closed to the public’ sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven’t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
Then find another way.
They’d never let me go. And you’d end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
I saw the ad at George’s.  I’m passing through town and I’m in a hurry.
How much of a hurry are you in?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
Finsbury Park. We’re in Finsbury Park.
Where are the kids?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Good.
I’ve got work tonight, Jane.
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelqu’un récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
What if it is?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Didn’t you say I came recommended?  That’s what I thought. May I know by whom?
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
I’m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Anything at all?
Vous êtes Français?
Let’s go.
This car needs petrol.
Maybe I don’t.
Is this Friedman?
I gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
A private investigator... You’re not Austrian?
Do you know Leon’s parents names?
Who else knows about the boy?
Er... Yes...
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Barstow’s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you’re heading, I reckon somebody’ll pick you up.
Welcome to the club.
Excuse me?
I take it you don’t know where he is, then?
J’ai bien peur qu’il te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matinée.
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
Fuck...
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
If he had, you’d be dead.
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
I don’t know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
Now?
Now?
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
No...
Do you have a sword?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
What are you doing?  This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
No no, I'm fine, really...
Really?
Quick -- hide in here...
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
What were you doing when the voice came?
The voice was in your cell?
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
You really think she's been sent... by God?
But... her army's so small now...
So how would you put it?
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
Does he have hair?
Go on to the next question.
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
The wind will be against us...
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
Yeah...
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
Why not?
What do you mean, they won't come?
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
No.  That was a sword in a field.
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
What for?
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
You think you are ready now?
But you already confessed this morning...
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Him?
Jeanne, be patient.
How are you doing?
Don't worry, it won't last long.
Dorota.
Sit.
I need help.
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
I haven't seen him.
And suppose they take the table away?
What's this about?
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
Boys, boys...
Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
What are you reading?
Yes, so did the Germans.
But I want to help, I want to.
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I forgot, that's what I mean.
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
Have a favour to ask. I want to get out of here.
Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
What's all that gunfire?
What about you?
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
Baines is packing up?
Which mountains are those dear?
Well, that is a strong opinion.
On your property?
You'd have to organise it up here.
Yes, I thought that.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
No, words. You have never heard words?
He's given it to us.
You the owner here?
What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
Yeh, go ahead.
You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
No.
Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
All of it.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's boost in Troy.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
I'm busy, Floyd.
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
I picked something up on the way.
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
You just worry about your end, kid.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
It was too noisy.
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
See ya and raise three.
The name is Lonnegan.
She coulda killed me last night.
Who are you?
It isn't any better.
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
All right, when?
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
I feel lucky tonight.
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
And you were gonna pay me back?
I'm in.
How am I gonna do that?
We were getting 50 from our guy.
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
Yes.  He admitted it.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
That is, if it's all right with you.
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
I'll do nothing of the sort.
He wouldn't say.
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
Come on in.
You heard about Julia Wolf?
She fell down.
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Yes.
No.
No.
What about this Nunheim?
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
Where were you?
All right.  All right.
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
I can't! I haven't got it!
What did you do with the rest?
What'll I do if something comes up?
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
No word at all?
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
What's that?
Why do you say that?
So it's you he was after!
Hello, baby.
I had him out this morning.
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
If you like 'em like that.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Isn't that my drink?
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
Someone get a doctor.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Who's that?
Did I give it to you?
You talk as if I were Asta.
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
Goodbye, darling.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
That's a fact.
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
Yes.
I wish you'd tell me who.
How did you get in here?
Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
Was he a good detective?
Where are you going?
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
Yeah!  Welcome to beautiful Iraq.  Land of enchantment and riches.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
You're the one with all the ideas.
Maybe I do.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
What!?  What!?
Now this is war.
They'll shoot us!
It'd make their heads explode.
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
What does it look like I'm doing?
Must be a compartment.
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
Forget Wes.
No.
And you; you've got it all together.
Sure.
Sorry.
I pick that way.
What do you figure it is?
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
To where?
What do you make of them?
When did you make the switch?
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
How do we do that?
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Threatened to blow my brains out?
Thought you were going to buy a car.
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
What!?
You ever think about dying?
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
I thought we were dead.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
4732...?
I haven't done anything.
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
Good Lord!
I can't see him at all.  He's been destroyed.
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
When?.....How?
...and you're not lost now?
What was that....
Yes
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
Officer Reilly, vice.
Aren't you on suspension?
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
I don't know. You tell me?
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
Why do you do it?
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Fuck factor?
Talk to me. Let's assess.
Yeah, another round thing.
I don't know.
What do you think?
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
What's the matter?
Why are we stopping here?
Alex, please-
Drop it.
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
Look who's talking, old man.
Mike...
Don't talk.
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
T.J., what're you doing?
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Captain...
Sir...
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
And it had diamonds in the back.
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
No.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
I don't want to see you at all!
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
I hope so, too.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
But not now.
Monescu.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
Gaston Monescu.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
Spanish passports?
Yes...?
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
That's too dark.
Beautiful specimen.
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
Good night.
Yes, I would!
Like that?
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
I'm crazy about you!
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
<u>Adolph</u>?
Yes, Madame Colet?
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Yes--uh--
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
What is it, madame?
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
You're certain?
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
Holy shit.
I told you you wanted to take this call.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
No thanks. I'm heading back.
You're a good liar.
Bollocks.
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
You're crazy.
Jack.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
And...?
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
I know, I know.
Will this work?
Don't come any closer.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
No-o!
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
Tell me.
Sooner it you like.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
Thanks.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
This is a business trip!
No, sir?
Change?
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
Partners, ain't we?
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
How about you?
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Yes--Me--in person!
Who won?
I didn't--
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
And you've put it over--haven't you?
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
I don't get the humor of that remark.
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
That's him! That's the sucker!!
You leave the kid alone.
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
That's the truth--every single word!
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
There you are, sir.
Ain't got time.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Isn't that a daisy?
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
You don't even know him.
Very instructive
Ignore her?
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
All right.  Then what?
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
Praise Jesus!
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
Doesn't suit you.
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
I don't know.  I'm all right.
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
But this time they'll be ready.
What'd you do that for?
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
How you doin', boy?
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
You'll never make that stick.
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
What - no lust for adventure?
Q! How are you?
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Paris -
His newspapers?
How is old Q?
Gone fishing.
I see...
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
Natalya?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
... Does this do anything?
Bourbon. Neat.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
Boyfriend?
No?
Down?
What now? And don't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me.'
Are you listening to me?
Sometimes you just have to -
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
And when might that be?
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
Sabotage?
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
What's your name?
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
I was an attorney!
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
How sweet.
That was too close.
Is the helicopter ready?
It's Bond!
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
You were in hell?
I'm busy.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
Good afternoon, ladies.
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
What must I do?
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
I was just trying to make conversation.
He is in his pigeon cage.
How are you?
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
To infinity and beyond!
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
Where was the last place you left him?
Hey!  Wow!
Hello-o-o...
T-O-Y.  Toy.
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
I could have stopped him.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
What happened to you?
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
Son of a building block, it's Woody!
I don't know!
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
Last present!
Bad news?!
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
Finn -
He'll murder you when he finds out.
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
Stop it!
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
I already lost everything once.
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
We're too young.
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
How much?
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
Don't bother.
So my wife is lying?
Carl --
Me, too.
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
Oh, it is?
Should we bring the police into this?
Did you meet the President?
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
Hi.
Sixteen
Live with your parents?
I'm third in my class.
You do?  What else you do?
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
I don't really like guns.  You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive.
So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City --
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
An informant.
I'm aware of that.
Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
Any idea how much?
You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.
Like you protected Landry?
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
OK. Same again?
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
Eh-
What?
Come on.
No, not holding hands.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
You're too young.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
No.
Clear?
That's nice.
I would say, in those days, he was a muscular actor, in every sense, with all the presence of someone like Cooper or Lancaster, but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead, closer in that respect to Cary Grant.
Running time?
You don't know, do you?
Roald Dahl.
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
Why?
What?
How much?
Well, it's up to you.
That's hardly a substitute.
What's on the menu this evening?
Sure.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
There.
Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
No joy yet.
Qual se tu?
And how did you breach the Barrier?
Admit it. We're lost.
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
Oh, God
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
I cannot be certain.
Spock.
There, you see? See?
Is it possible?
You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an "s."
No conditions.



I am a Starfleet Officer.
I cannot go with you.
Sybok, we must find a way...
You did break in.
You invented Space Paranoids?
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Did you say Group 7 access?
Did he say why?
What for?
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
For sure...
Way to go! We're haulin'!
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
I'm sorry -
The Pentagon?
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
User requests are what computers are for.
That was uncalled-for.
Who is your User, program?
Where did you hear that name?
How about over there...that empty memory?
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
There's another beam!
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
We have to talk.
But-what if I can't...?
Wait...I need that...
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
There's another guy, still in the car.
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
Is this national security stuff boring you?
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
She's still at my house.						*
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
She's lying.
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.
Yes sir.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
Yes.
That's fabulous Harry.
What did you tell him?
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
What did happen?
You weren't attracted to him at all?
What did you need?
I think so.
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
Use 'em and lose 'em.
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
Like one?
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
And you chased one?
To our assignment.
How?
Hello, Alabama.
That was so good I am gonna have another.
You got that playing basketball?
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
How 'bout me what?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Very much. Now, where were we?
What kinda music do you like?
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Wow. What a swell place to work.
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
What's that?
God, Spiderman looks different.
I love Janis.
She OD'd, didn't she?
You mean she got a bad batch?
That dazzling imagination.
Yes.
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
Why?
I think what you did was...
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Yeah.
You wanna get unhaunted?
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
You'd really do that?
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
Good for you.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
Elliot Blitzer.
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
I'd fuck Elvis.
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
Leave the gorillas.
He wants to talk ya.
No.
Say it, goddamn it!
Have you read the story on Elvis?
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
Wanna count your money?
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
What do you want from me?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
What makes you think I would do that?
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
But a fuckin' baggie.
Suspect's words -
You do more than try.
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.
Rock whores.
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Sorta room-mates?
How do you know? You been there?
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
We're very close!  Because of you!
What's she doing?
They forced me to take drugs.
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
I need to go now.
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
What kind of information?
You wouldn't understand.
You're afraid of germs?
What?
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
The gun! ... I lost it
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
You want me to rob him?
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
What are you talking about???
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
Hey, man...
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
He no!
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
More or less.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Never heard of it.  It's got no day or date.  Hell, it ain't even got numbers.  What's the matter?  You couldn't afford a Timex?
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
But, in particular?
The ticket is thirty dollars.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
They look nice.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
What happened to your hand?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
Did you like it; me watching you?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
I have ideas.
Games?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Doesn't the heat bother you?
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Take me with you.
Jake.
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
John?  John where are you going?
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Because I know you're full of shit.
I could if I had Jake's money.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
What was I supposed to do?
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?
Yeah.  Good thinking.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
Now what?
But I want to say with you,
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
No.  I swear it.
Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
Who the hell are you?
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
How do you know if you've never tried?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
I'm not rambling.
Do we shake hands?
You didn't kill her?
You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
Shut up.
Darrell giving you problems?
I came to kill her.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
Come on, Jake--
Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
What are you babbling about?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
For what?
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
Kids.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Hey!  You there!
You want something?
I said I was sorry.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
More or less.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
I was hoping we could talk.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
That's a bit much.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
How do you want it?
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
Got any requests?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Open up!
I want my car.
Got any cold soda?
I'm just going to my car?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
I guess it must.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
You don't have any money put away, do you?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Stop it.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I could if I had Jake's money.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
Grace ... Grace?
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
Why?
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
"Arkady"
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
The old lady?
I need a ticket.
Out of here.
But, in particular?
How much?
One way.
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
What was that all about?
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
They look nice.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Is Noel in?
I don't know. It's been a while.
Oh shit...
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
Yes.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
I don't know Megan.
At the church... You were following me weren't you?
What do you want?
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
I won't make any noise.
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
No.
No.
Did you get up from your seat?
He give 'em names?
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
Mmmm pistols.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
Is... is it... loaded?
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Did... you... get... him?
Say, Bill...
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
You ain't shot.
Huh?
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
Three ways?
It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
Yeah.
HEY.
You're marking us, Bill.
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Hullo, paw.
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
I don't like the question.
Maybe.
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
I don't know what you came here for, but we won't have any part of it.
You heard right.
Can we stealth these guys?
What the hell do you want?
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
You watch your mouth.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
You set up the line-up.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
When does he post bail?
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
He didn't have my lawyer.
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
Came from Redfoot.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
You're stalling, Verbal.
Then what?
Wait a minute.
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
I don't know what you're talking about.
Then why didn't you help him?
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
You think he's..?
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
Nothing.
How good's your intelligence?
Four cases in three years ...
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
...I was one of a group of...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Through, through his book.
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
Nothing further, your Honor.
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
Yes.
Just now...
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
I...yes.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
What is this going to cost?
Hold on a second.
You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
That's what I'd planned to...
Yes.
Her doctors killed her.
The most respected ...
Thank you ...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
You know what happened.
Nothing happened.
What is it?
Why?
Why don't you get some rest?
Isn't there something you...
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
If I don't 'grow up...'
Joe...  Joe...
No.
Dr. Gruber's not in.
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
...he's a good man...
Admittance form is wrong.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
Uh...the admitting nurse...
The 'History'...?
...yeah...good...
... I know.  I went ...
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Mrs. Simmonds.
What happened in those three minutes...?
Should I?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
How long have you been back?
Almost a year.
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
Well?
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Just let me talk to you.
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
About three years.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
Don't go.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
No.
Yes.
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
Where are you going?
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
You can't. You're afraid!
Scottie, please...!
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
I made it.
Why?
Please drink your coffee.
-- talking to you...
I don't know.
Shopping?
Do you know where you're going?
Would you like a drink of water?
Where are you now?
Long ago...
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
Take me away from here?
A grave...
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
Don't leave me... stay with me...
Why? What's happened?
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
Yes --
And it's a all real.
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Let me go.
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
Does she sleep here? Ever?
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
Ow!!
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
What's tomorrow?
What do you mean?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
It wasn't your fault.
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
How's your love life, Midge?
Normal.
I think I can lick it.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Pop Leibel.
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
Jesus.
Can't do what?
How ya doing?
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
And you're a little fucking reject.
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
Wait!
Are you sure this was an accident?
What about the blood?
Don't talk to me about character.
Adam! Calm down.
They won't figure it out.
Don't snap at them!
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
I don't think so.
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
What?
Is everything okay?
Call 911.
I'm calling the police.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
I said, what have we done?
What's your point?
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
False.
Not true.
You have a King fantasy.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
What? What's your point?
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
Goosed!
Florist?
I think so.
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
I wouldn't know.
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
I just don't see him in the big picture.
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
With all my heart.
Go down where?
I love you.
Where are you?
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
What's the word on the chairs?
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Do you love me?
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
Micheal, by accident.
It's too late.
She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all...
But...
I just want her to be happy.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
Give them to Refugio.
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
You have no feelings toward ...
Come down here, you scamp.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
You must think I'm mad.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
That's fifteen by seven?
Me?
He was asking for it.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
And ...your friend?
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
A black bull came.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.

My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
I should have told him.
You think he's smart?
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
Think you can do it?
Barnes, where the hell have you been?!
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.

Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
Help me get out of here.
No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?

It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
See something?
Nice work.
Can I ask you something?
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
More or less.

How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
...that's what it is.
"Back End" ... count on it.
Three-o-three...
I saw it on TV.
I think it's fine?
...we get our hands on him?
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
Mmm...
...that's right.
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
I've come to feel It's my thing.  You know, you take a job... You take a job, and, many times, it's <u>just</u> a job.  And then...
Big mistake.
We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."
They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  <u>Isn't</u> he...
Y'know what else bothers me?  "Shh lil baby, don' saya word, papa's gon buy you a mocking bird..."  The baby don'say a word, WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MOTHERFUCKING MOCKING BIRD GONE SAY?  You follow me...?
A proud tradition.
What're you doing?
I'm looking for a phone...
Deal's changed.
...what am I <u>doing</u>?  Do you see me working...?  Here's what you want to do, you want to come out of the box, an item, someone 'ready <u>has</u>, but <u>then</u> you sell it to'em.  Torn <u>jeans</u>, uh ... faded Levi Jackets, uh... uh...
Bunny:  I had an idea:  a Slinky, that falls <u>Up</u>...  Naa, we can figure that <u>out</u>.  What I'm wondering:  what do we <u>call</u> it...  You got my number... 
All part of the Service we Render.
We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.
Oh huh...
A wider option of what?
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?
....beautiful.
Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
Whatever night you like.
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
So you're hot on this stock?
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
So what's the problem?
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
My home number's on the back...
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
No sir, that would've been illegal...
What? How do you know about my father?
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
I guess I'll head back...
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Hello Bud.
I gather you're a decorator.
And what do you want?
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko.
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Hi.
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
He did?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
Safety in numbers man.
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
Fine.
What?
That can't feel good.
Who are you?
I've seen you.  From the window.
Hello?
Tell me.  I can help you.
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
You know where she is?
I don't know.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
What is it?
Sit down here.
But Claire--
Oh God...you knew.
Adamant?
I can't believe this is happening.
Like what?
Did he say that?
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
What's their name?
It's today?
Fine.
And we moved out here for the quiet.
Oh.
Claire?
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
What kind of whispering?
That's...
Get down!  He'll see.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
What am I looking at?
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Dressed?
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
Are you lonely?
What are you doing out here?
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
In the living room...
It's too rough.
"You know..."
Stop...
Claire...
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Mmmuh...
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
Then what is he...?
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
She didn't feel them
FAST.
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?
You're very clever, aren't you...?
I know that you're evil.
Harder...
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
Doctor's orders- - -?
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
Hello...?
Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
What about your work back home...?
That's GREAT!
Their what...?
You alright...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
I'm getting --- left behind.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
So there is only one key...
And it can't be forged?
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
Sure...
I lost the touch
Do you take sugar?
What's with all the locks - and hammering
Yes - I'm sorry ELLEN...
You don't know?
Where do you kill them...
I don't know
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
How long have you been watching me?
You've killed but you're not a killer
And how did it feel to be rid of him
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
It's been what, three years?
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
Her husband left her
That's good
See? Did you see that?
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
You'll never believe who's in there.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Yeah?
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
It was the year of the rhizopus rot. Grandpa almost lost the farm. You sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival. And in the end you saved the peaches and you didn't have to slaughter your sow.
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
It's okay. You need me?
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
What do you want me to do?
You're on the next plane home.
I understand.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
He was my Grandfather, too.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Funny you should say "peachy."
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
I see.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
But you never do.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
You called the cops on us?
I do?
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
I was thinking, Antigua, maybe.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
And the child...
Then what?
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
He did say something.
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
What did you do then?
Ms. Toller?
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
I would hardly say you look like trash.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
So, where you off to now?
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
Just like that?
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
You mean this thing?
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
But don't pull that again.
Eight scientists.  Eight different fields of endeavor.  Hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
Starting with a screw?
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
All what?
All that jumping and kicking.
Well... that, too.
This is good.
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
It was in your book.
What is this?  A whole new train?
Yes, me!
He's not giving up?
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
You bring the best out in a man.
Nicely said, sir.
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
That would be... the Mexican War?
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
Easy now.
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
Hey...!
You're not going to use it, are you?
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
He's no magician.
Then you get us out of here.
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Are you okay?
Farmer.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
Hey!  Give me that baby!
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
Want me to carry Elora?
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
What's the magician's weapon?
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
But what am I gonna transform??
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
Are you sure?
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
Don't let them hurt you.
Have you got your gun on now?
Yeah.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
Now what's the problem?
No.
Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
Where are you taking us now?
No, no doctor...
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know – anybody who knows John – knows that's a goddamn lie!
Yes, thank you very much.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Momma... are they angry with us.
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
From now on you'll be history
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
Hickory!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Run, Toto, run!
Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
Toto, too.
Aw, come, come, come --
...bed.
Oh -- 
And bears!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
How about a hippopotamus?
Does it work?
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Ohhhh --
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
He said his mouth.
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
...along.
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
Somebody pulled my tail.
Oh, you did it yourself!
And you're going to lead us.
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
Up!
I haven't slept in weeks.
Why don't you try counting sheep?
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Oh - look out.
What is it?
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He’s a man of great integrity.
I’ve scheduled a medical for you.
It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
I was the one who brought that money in...
The report King bought. It’s a manual. Renard’s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
The inside man?
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
Who did you get it from?
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
In case you’ve forgotten.  I’m dead already.
The killer doesn’t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn’t want to see you take over...
What the hell are you doing here?
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
...what?
So you killed your father.
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I’m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather’s name, the glory of my people.
Bond, I’m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
What’s your business with Elektra King?
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
Had a lot of blood in him.
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
The bearer of bad news.
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
What's your theory?
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
Jon -- what??
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
What is it?  How does it work?
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
. . . What?
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
That's because --
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
What new information?
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
I can fix it.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
I don't know their real names!
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
Am I free to go?
He's a little farther gone every time.
Maybe I'll do that.
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
What do I get out of it?
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
Mind your business.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
We'll have to go after them.
What was that for?
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Nice hops.
Dude, what are you doing here?
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
What's this?
What's "Anarchy 99"?
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
That was for Anders.
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
How long have you been in Alaska?
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
He takes his work seriously.
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
The intention of registration act -
What is it you intend to do to me?
Now that's Magneto talking.
The way what is going to be?
Is it that music?
Miss me?
Of course.
I hope you like large weddings.
I suppose you're right.
Yes!... the laboratory.
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
Dr. Frankenstein?
Fron kon steen!
One week at the most!?
I beg your pardon?
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
A piece of what?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
How old are you, young man?
Nineteen, sir.
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
Are you putting me on?
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
I'm sure we will.
Are these your bags?
