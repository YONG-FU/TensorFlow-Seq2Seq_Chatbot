Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
You're sweet.
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
Hi, Joey.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
In 9th.  For a month
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
And where're you going?
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Why not?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
That's what I just said
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Dead at forty-one.
Okay!  I wasn't sure
It's her favorite band.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
She's partial to Joey, not me
Sure
Then, go get her
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
You and Verona?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Just a little.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
I know a lot more than that
And why would I do that?
Seven-thirty?
Hi
Like you could find one
Dorsey.
Then why'd you ask?
What are you doing here?
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
It's just something I had.  You know
Oh huh
As a parent, that's my right
No, Daddy.
Parts of it.
I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
But -- who -- what --?
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
That's something you can't decide.
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
He understands.
You never learned how to speak my language.
How can you be so certain?
Esdras is a Jew.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Give me absolution.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
New worlds create new people.
That she was impregnable.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
And what do you think Mendez?
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
But it's...
Give me another one, please.
Yeah.  This way.
I'm sorry.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
Daphne, I...
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
What are you saying?
No, what is it?
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
I'm on duty.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Raw deal.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
My point exactly.
So am I.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
What do you want?
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
You're ruthless.
Well, that's great.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
I have five-hundred dollars.
Is there a problem?
How long are you planning to stay?
Okay.
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
New York.
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Don't stoop to his level!
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
Right. Just a sec.
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
No. I never did, either.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Are you reasonably awake?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
Well, what is it?
In three days, darling, I hope.
She's in the bathroom.
Goodbye, Daddy.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Fortunately, they did.
That's true
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Great, just great.
Vodka.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
Whaddya mean, buy?
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
No chance.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
I'll think about it.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
I'm helpin' you, huh?
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Want to try it again?
I think you better put him on ice, man.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
Shit.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
So you took the rest of the night off...
Luther's on the move...
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Nothing.
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
That's the way I see it, too.
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
Let's go, Reggie.
That's what I always say.
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
How would you know?
Shut up.
Yeah, old times.
First, the money.
So you do know her.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
Thank you, Mr. President.
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
Leeloo..
...Ma???
Found it?
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
To save the world.
Just one... why me?
And the third one?
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
The wind blows... the fire burns...
...The rain falls...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
Options.
Amen..
I'm not at the hotel!
Got it.
I love you.
I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
You don't understand...
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
Don't...
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
Machine.
What's the problem?
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
Take out your gun!
Look, I don't know what this...
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
How'd you find me here?
How much did he pay you?
It was a lot of fucking money.
You got absolute zero.
I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
You are a private investigator?
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
You're asking me why?
Fuck you.
Yeah... guess so.
Three, four years.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
I'm not a cop.
What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
It won't work like that.
You're joking.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
Do you think the police did a good job?
That's her suitcase.  I had forgotten it, till you showed me her picture.
I haven't slept much either.  Since Kristen...
Then we'll stay up together.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Then you saw him, too?
Is there something we can do?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
It's okay, we're just about there.
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
Earth to Alice...
Let me talk to you.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
Huh?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Very funny.
I've got to go.
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
Mark!
Nobody thinks that.
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
No shit.
Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
Faint.
How is he - ?
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
Oh it does???
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
What direction does the system indicate?
There is.  I believe our friend...Cyclops... is returning to life!
It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
That's what I said!
What?
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
You don't believe me?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
Oh.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
That was me.
Deers have ears too.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Was it funny?
What then?
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
See, I knew you'd be mad.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Where do you expect to wait for her? Obviously downstairs with the other kids isn't good enough.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Fine.
I want to go home.
Oh.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Fuck you.
Huh?
Yeah. A few things.
Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
On what you pay me?
See. Get your boots.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
How's she doing?
Okay. She's fine.
Said what?
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
You're not using it today?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Something about my father?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
The other guy.
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
He got his deer yet?
Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally done it! Like a man done it. Done it right. I love you, you mean sonofabitch!
Wade?
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
That it wasn't an accident.
Not particularly.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
Yeah, no duh.
I'm sure he's busy.
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
Yeah. Do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
How `bout a hug for the old man.
I prefered the terrorists.
Stand by.
A dubious distinction, no?
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
My husband is a very courageous man.
One thing I've learned as
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
No, Mr. President.  It can't.
No. I thought about this, Mr.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
But...
Yeah, right.
Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
Did we tape the Duke game?
That's my job.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
I just wish it was that simple.
Ask Simon.
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Elaine, we have to go back.
Elaine, what's going on?
Ted, there's no time to explain.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Now!
I mean for Ted.
I'm so excited, Simon.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Don't be too long.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
That's okay, ROK.
Go ahead.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
All right.  Here.
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Certainly.
Ted!
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
You expect me to believe that?
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
Here.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
Yes?
Thank you.
The cockpit? What is it?
Would you go up, please?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
Show me.
Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Did you talk to him?
We'd like to ask you about a business associate of your, Warren Hubley.
That's very colorful.  But see -- now I've got a problem.  I don't seem to be getting much cooperation from you, Porter.  So I guess we're gonna have to take this little session down to my office, ya know?
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
... and Porter ran a piece of shit mom-and-pop mini-mart.  So what the hell's the connection?
I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
We can't let him get away.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
Sure.  Just a minute.
Yeah... I seen him around.  High- roller dude named Strader.  Joshua Strader.  Runs a club on the west side.  Encounters.
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
I can't!  Do you mind!
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
Could it be intelligent?
I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
Dead on all channels.
I don't know.
Unknown.  But, it looks like all of them.  Over at the processing station...sublevel 'C' under the south tower.
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Stand back.
We ain't going anywhere.
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
I'll be right back.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
Humiliated?
Are you drunk? You invited me. And my horse. Here he is. Ottavio!
Why?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
That's stupid.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
What?
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
Oh yes? You always know everything.
You borrowed money from your mother?
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
What's the matter with you?
What?
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Why?
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Originals?
Oh, thank you, sir!
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
He needs me, ma'am.
Leave him alone!
Well, this is none of your business.  Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Yes. He is a little strange.
Majesty.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Ah, love again.
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
Pupils?
This one will.
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
I will, sir.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Why? What has happened?
What medicine?
Are you Herr Mozart?
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
Animals?
Well, we can.
Really?
Ah!
But this is absurd!
How could I not?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
What work?
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
What time?
Fourth measure, second beat - F.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
Exactly. A dance.
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
Taking out what you should never have put in.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
Leave me alone.
Are they?
I do not seek forgiveness.
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
All Vienna has heard that.
Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
What difference does that make?
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
Excuse me, my dear.
Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly!
Go about your duties.
Warn him?
Yes.
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Yes, I should think so.
David?
Will you give me a break?
Shall I read to you?
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
Not just a patient -- me.
I was dreaming again?
I would think so.
Yeah, I would think so, too.
Good.
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
Pull over.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
No.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
No!
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
No, but we're about to.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
She's a jerk.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
She says she 'likes me too much'.
That's a wolf's head.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
Do you think it's a dog?
Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
David!
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
What?!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
What do you think?
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
You must believe me.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Send them in.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
I beg your pardon?
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
Yes - sure—
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Matt?
How much?
What good will that do?
Take it easy, Clark.
You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
They took my keys yesterday. I went there to get them back.
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
I haven't got it.
What is?
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
Got a handkerchief?
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
The theatre?
Yes, of course.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Where is he now?
Good morning.
All right. Send him in.
Yes, sir.
I can't tell you.
But I haven't . . .
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
No.
Yeah.
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
Are you sure?
There you are!
Then where were you?
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
Sometimes a wound will kill.
What have you done?
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Best damn plan I heard all war.
Exactly.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
What's going on?
She got two of them.
So what do we do, General Lee?
Perfect, Cole.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
They're just insurance in case we run.
Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
I reckoned.
Maybe, maybe...
Heard of him.
Damn. All that reading paid off.
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
Yeah.
They're making him a hero now.
A fair number, Ma.
You're sick of my company?
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
You didn't want to farm?
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Where will you find such a girl?
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Yes ma'am.
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
Damn.
I figured.
That's what I would have done.
You cocky little bastard.
You don't think God'll mind, do you?
Right here in church?
Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
You been with a girl ever?
I swear.
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
I can completely understand your distress, sir.
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
How much did they get from the safe?
What is going on here, man?
I remember you.
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
In English, Pinkerton.
Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Turn the light on.
Take it off.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Because I...want...to...fit...in.
He's rich.
He has a great body
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.
We never really shared one.
Nice.
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
What exactly do you mean?
It looks so soft.
Patrick?
This.
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Oh really? That's great.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Patrick?
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
Oh no. I have no plans.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Sorry. 
Well...
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Next Saturday?
Don't tell him you're here.
You're at Paul Owen s.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Shoot.
You seem...nervous.
I know. I'm sorry.
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
It's just strange.  One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
Don.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
I'm so hungry.
I'm hungry.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
I've been great. And you?
Oh well, you know.
Is that a raincoat?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
'Gonna wait outside.
"Make" him?
...But?
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
It was a hate crime.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
I can't just walk away!
Remember Lyle Barton?
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
That'll be a test, won't it?
Right... What's that mean again?
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
Outpost doesn't own em.
There's a rumor going around, maybe you've heard it.
Don't spend too much time searching. You ever vetted somebody's old code before?  It's a different skill. Stay close to the surface. The best-hidden secrets are in plain sight. You know the best place to hide a leaf, right?  In a tree.
Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
Did you?
I meant did you find other stuff to --
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
What're we looking for?
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Hmm?
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?
I don't know --
What'd he say?
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Please don't go.
Is that how Larry feels?
What?!
I met this girl.
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Behave!
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
To my health.
Good luck, Austin.
Oh, and Austin...
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Thanks.
Be careful.
Oh, and Austin...
Excuse me?
Not quite, actually. Vanessa, I have something for you.
Good on ya, man.
Oh forget it. As a fellow player on the international stage, Mr.  Powers, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
He's too well-protected right now.
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
I'm sorry.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
Where did you learn to shoot?
Silence!
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
In due time.
Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
Scott.
Really?
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
Rules are made to be broken.
You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
The Institute ... the funding ...
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
So am I.
An unholy trinity ...
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
I'll never marry you.
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
Do you really think so?
That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
Any other vices?
You mean my other self ...
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
Winning isn't everything.
Shall we?
Have a look at this.
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
As a matter of fact I have ...
Not quite.
Who's now vanished.
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
No, please! I beg you ...
Perish the thought.
But did they teach you this?
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Women!
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Mr. Thomerson.
Fine. How's everything going?
Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
I've tried to change her mind.
I think your dinner's burning.
Are you going to have women at your party?
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
About what?
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
You better not have too much joy.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
Why don't you get undressed.
Ilene, are you crazy?
Any time, Al.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Ha, ha, ha.
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
You've been having strange sex...!
It's all right...  So have I.
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
Take care.
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
You said you wanted to know something, Brian. What did you learn today?  What do you say, Brian, huh? Time to move on?
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
What are we going to do about this?
Shut up!
Huh.
When I was twenty.
Yeah...
You think that's really any of your business?
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
I don't know anything about it.
Just take it.
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
Four months.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
Backdraft.
Call in another alarm. We're gonna need some back-up.
Fixing my roof.
He's got piano lessons.
He's going to be a fireman.
-- You remember.
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
You treated me like shit.
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
Yeah? When was the last time?
What's wrong?
I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
That's your job.
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
He works for me.
Did he tell you how we finally met?
And the world -- the whole world.
I need that report, Lt.
Me?
All right, cop. I want my money.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
B-L-A-K it is.
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
Please.
What's your name?
I'm a revolutionary.
Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to go there.  We can all agree to disagree without making threats.
Why are you smiling so?
Seconds and thirds, too.
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
What are you talkin' about?
Did we get our bill yet?
I'm tired of waiting.
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
Go on.  Good so far.
What are there character traits?
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
Hello.
I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my throat.  For the love of Joseph.
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
Everybody shut up.
A gift.
How so?
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
I didn't mean it to sound like that.
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
Same thing Giuliani said.
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
I just turned twenty.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Give or cousins some of dem educated feets.
...not that time...
...like fried and chicken...
You slept too near where you got in?
A song a comin' I feel.
Oh you do, huh?
No, before my time.
What?
You look beautiful like that.
Just ask me what you want to know.
We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned.
Aw, c'mon.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
I never was more in earnest.
What is the service, sir?
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
And his baggage?
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
Your cousins go out with him.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Not even that.
Not one.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
The Prince left him only that choice.
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Papa?
Is he all right, papa?
Who?
What do we do?
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
We found him like this...
Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
Yeah, we know, Pike did.
Yeah...
Bullshit.
Just look. Little pocket.
They?
What don't you know?
We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
What about the confession?
I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
You knew Sergeant West?
You and the Colonel go back.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Yes.
Good cop/bad cop?
I lost a bet.
Got it.
Watch me.
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
I don't think I want to hear this --
To start a fire, goddammit!  What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work --
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone.  It was because I threatened him.
What the fuck are you doing?
Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
We're not going anywhere.
Shut up!
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
Yes!
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink. I'll tell you all about it. Hell, I'll have him tell you.
Your mother came in about three in the afternoon. Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in Wichita. You were born a week early, but there were no complications. It was a perfect delivery. Now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it wasn't the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so I can't see as it would have been much different had he been there. And that's the real story of how you were born.
Well, she... uh...
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
And I like you.
I can.
Okay.
Beats me.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
I will.
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
You think I'm fake.
The river?
They're your favorite flower.
'Fraid so.
Because he's dying.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
You need to go.
He's up with your father.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Really! That's wonderful.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Yes. But that's a different...
So you never bought any land.
What for?
I paid for those guitar cases.
It is. I did it cooking.
Thank you.
Name it.
What are you doing here?
Leave him!
Right.
Right.
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
I...
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Yes.
What's wrong?
I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
What?
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
You don't want to talk about it.
No.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
Well what have you got?
No.
Laugh it up.
I'm trying to quit.
Nobody's that unhappy.
It's alright.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
I need to uh...
What do you need?
I do. God's truth. I do.
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here.
She's around. Always is.
You need a ride?
Now wait...
You go to hell.
Here. Pound this and I'll join you.
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
Come on, gal...
The fuck you been doin' to me?
God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
Or what?
GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!
Uh-uh.
To freedom.
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
He knows where ya at. Just answer the door if he come knockin'.
Why's his britches round his knees?
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
Then what?
The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
Yes'sir.
You could put it that way.
Rae don't do this now...
What?
I'm a what?
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
No.
I didn't know.
Hey, when in Rome --
I hope not.
Connie...
You'll take care of that.
What's the problem here?
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
I don't, that's all.
I can see that.
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
There she is!
You were too far behind.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
I couldn't tell.
Why's that?
There was a change in plans.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
I'm taking you back.
Thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
Look.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
I'll pay you.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
Anywhere.
You underestimate the trap, Mary.
Then go get him.
Come here.
Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
Like...
Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
Soon as I finish the job.
Day after tomorrow.
Okay, but...
And what in your estimation works?
I don't know.
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
Let's hear it.
Considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
Of course.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
Sorry.
Why not?
You did?
Yeah.  Sometimes.
Like?
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
What difference will it make?
What?
Yes.
Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  Plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
Sorry.
But how come I'd be there?
Know what a turtle is?
Of course.
Same thing.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
You're all so perfect.
Really?
Do ya?
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
No, I'm lost.
Oh, that's nice.
It's Perry!
Perry?
I can't, it's yours.
Take it. damn it!
I haven't brushed yet.
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
What?
What's the pay?
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Yes.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
Stop that ma'am crap!
What?!
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
May I please be excused?
That's boring!
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Yes!
How 'bout this one?
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Did you?
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry!
Goodnight!
Really?  Okay!
...I do.
Nothing.
A card?
Yes, sir.
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Uh-huh.
And it's called...?
Juneau.
No.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
I just don't want to.
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
Does that work?
What?
Goodnight.
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
I'll go up.
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
If I...you know...
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
And I made these!
Well, we did in my family!
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
Yes, dear, I know.
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
That's what I'm sensing.
Yes, you do!
Or have perfect table manners.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
He didn't leave with them.
You're goddamn right I am!
What?!
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Stop!
Um...uh...
Stand by. One.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Who knows you have these?
Yes sir. I sure am.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Yeah.
I wanted to see you.
Yes.
See my breasts? See?
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
Falling.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Hello.
That's good.
Frank would open you.
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Just get outta my bed.
Yes.
What?
From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh? You wanta go for a ride?
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
If you want to.
On a ride.
A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
Actually. I've been in twice.
Yeah?
That's what I thought.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
Goodnight.
You want to go talk to him?
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Okay, but I promise I won't mention you. Okay? I'll see him at the police station, okay? See you Friday night, if not before.
What is it?
Just some fatherly advice.
I can't dance fast.
NO.
Let's wait for some slow one.
Right. Watch out for Mike, there.
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
Okay.
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.
Aye.
Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
Any word back from the E.R.s?
Where's your gun?
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
You sound real remorseful.
You think they sold me out? No way.
What happened?
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
All right, I suppose you have the right ta know.
We... met them last night.
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
Spanish.  Then I guess he's just real... real good.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
I don't know they just always need it.
Me, too.
A-fuckin'-men!
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
Rule of thumb?
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
Male or female, bitch?!!
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two.
What?
Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.
No way they could have seen it.
Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard!
Hey Murph.
Hey, Murph.
Y'know it is, a bit.
What the fuck do you mean?
You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
I believe these young men are right.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Open it!
What do you want me to say?
Yeah boss?
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
Hang on a second.
Yeah.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
We know there's another stocker.
Like he meant it.
What do you think?
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Don't even say it, man.
You were spoiled rotten.
I'll say it.
Bob?
Which one was that?
That's a long time to be in jail.
Where was I?
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
She doesn't need to know.
No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
We've got sixteen dollars.
She needed it.
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
Any activity?
Where's Kumar?
There's not enough time.
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
How big is it?
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
That's a sharp jacket.
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
It feels good.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
See you, Bob.
What was that?
There's a million places to hide around here.
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
He looked too shaken-up.
Sixty days?
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Why do you say that?
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Feel this.
Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
The one and only Little Richard.
I thought your parents were in Italy.
My brother.
What did I say?
Let's just go.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
I don't know.
What are you talking about?
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
I don't know.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
Come on, Dignan.
All right! Backyard! Right now!
Look. We want you on the job.
Jesus Christ.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
Right. I'm sorry.  You've got a reputation to think about.
He said you ran away from home.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
One last push. One.
That's not gonna fly.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
No... It must have been Bourne.
No good options left?
What do you have, Danny?
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Yes...
I did.
I'm sorry.
-- take the back -- get another car --
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
So...
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
Switch! You drive!
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
Who is Pamela Landy?
Abbott?
No. You never worked Berlin.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
You never worked Berlin...
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
You didn't answer my question.
Now. Show now.
Is there. Is all there.
Me? Four years.
So he fooled you.
Alright...
Felt promising. It's a start.
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
Scotland. He intends --
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
It matters not, he is thy king!
I do not confess.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
It does me good to see you.
No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
What is it?
Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
Why? What for?
And the bad news?
Honey. What were you doing with that?
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
Yes.
No, protecting her.
Where are my goddamn books?
Books?
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
I've stopped a hundred times.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett.
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
I don't get it.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
Me neither.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
And you are...?
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
What's wrong with you?!
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Yes?
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
Yes, I'll bet.
You want my advice?
Oh, yes, please.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
But Sacha always puts out that light --
Yes, I come, I will do it.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
Er, my check, please.
What do you want for Sam?
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
No.
Yes?
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
I don't know the finish yet.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
And Laszlo?
Because you're getting on that plane.
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
We'll discuss it later.
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
No, Victor, there isn't.
Of course, I'll be careful.
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
Your work.
Thank you. I try.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
Thank you.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
Goodnight.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
What else, my dear Major?
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
But I have no excuse to close it.
Ask Monsieur Rick.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
His escape.
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
I'm a drunkard.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
-- You thought what?
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
Sorry.
No, sir. I'm staying right here.
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
Thirsty.
They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
No!
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
Die tomorrow or die today.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
There was an unavoidable delay.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
You?  Personally?
So do I.
You don't seem too happy about it.
And for you --
Could you watch Jango?
So simple to say, so hard to do.
You too.
I'm so glad you're alive.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Anything else?
Sure.
Yeah.
So did I.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
It was fifteen minutes late.
I was making a point.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
I'm trying to help you here.  There's Warsaw, there's this --
You beat 'em to shit, pal!  Jesus!
Want to see my raft?
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
Some new *things* would be useful. I don't need any "new help."
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
Dr. Homer Wells.
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
Candy. Candy Kendall.
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
Mr. Rose *knows*?
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
Yes, I *have*!
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Did you know your mother better?
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
Liberator...
Where are you going?
Is it true?
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
I don't know it.
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have *dozens*!
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
So what?
Almost.
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Yes it is, Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her!
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
And what about Big Al?
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
That's it.
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
I think two million.
Hey Skippy? Do I have the word "chump" tattooed on my forehead?
You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
I gotta go get a haircut.
It's what I do. It's my job.
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
Sounds respectable.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
What do you want? An apology?
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
You know, this is kind of embarrassing, but my wallet was stolen yesterday and I'm afraid the ticket was in it. But the name's Pearson.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
A little bit of both.
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
I try.
You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
I'll take you up on that.
Goodnight.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
A couple I know are getting married.
Eight-fifty.
Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
I'm working on that soccer story.
I'll try and make it.
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
You mean I won't resist them.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
I had training. In the Republic.
I don't know.
I'll see you in my dreams.
What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me.
Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
What?
Yes, I know that.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
First visit to London?
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
Toss you for it.
That's fine.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
Who's they?
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Yes.
Yes.
How long have you worked at the casino?
I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat.
And the girls?
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
"The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway.
Don't worry.
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
We check every four days.
How?
Fine.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
Yeah.
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Time to start talking.
Thanks.
Huh?
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
Ah, negative drop.
I like it up here.
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
What's that, sir?
Well, what you might try is --
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
This won't hurt.  Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D.  Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out.
You mean until you showed up?
You're roommates?
Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
Later.
I got overhead...
Hello...
When?
There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
Whoever that is.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
C'mere, I want to show you something.
C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
What's in it for you?
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
Not in any pain...the good and bad news of a blown out spinal cord.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
I need to talk to her.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
Here's your money.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
Straight.
No.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
How long you and me known each other?
But I'll take a rain check...
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
True, but--
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
No, I mean... you love your son?
I-I c-can't...
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's.
Plenty, but it was all bad.
YO, DOOFUS!
Damn straight we are.
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Oh, yeah...?
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
They're what?
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
What happened?
Theoretically.
So... that's it?
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
Beg pardon?
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
Take it off. I want to see you.
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
I'm sorry.
Will you go with me?
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
Infant Memory Generators.
The whole movie. Let's go.
Where is she?
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
Do they know yet?
You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
Yes.
I met a girl.
Can anyone else see him?
No. That makes you keep searching.
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
Have you ever made love, Donald?
Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
Yes. I went to jail.
Regret.
Why?
God exists because you're horny.
Goodbye, Donald.
Guess who wrote it?
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
You're not a bitch.
What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Kitty...
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Beg pardon?
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
Yah?
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
We was robbed.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
And the bite marks on my ears?
"Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
Listen, little missy, this cost your dad a pretty penny. Now get your ass up there and show me some teeth.
"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
Take a letter.
"My dear President"...
You do and I'll fire you.
Gloria, much as I hate to leave, I'd be crazy to stay here.
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
What do you whistle?
I don't want him.
Oh no, I can't do it.
No, but I shot some ducks.
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
Why wasn't I insulted?
What did you say to her?
By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
I can't do it...
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth...  ...but we can have a little family of our own.
No... it was a seven letter word.
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
Well, these things take time.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Did you see it?
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
Right... Right.
Yes sir.
No, more of an acquaintance.
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Good! How is the patient?
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
I don't understand.
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
I am very pleased to meet you.
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
Is he... dying then?
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
Want to come out?
Of course! You want out?
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
The main spire.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Yes.
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Mmmerrick.
Righteousness...
Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you!
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
Of course! What did you think?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
The children! May I see?
Your mother?
Yes, John?
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
You did this for me?
No, no, I wouldn't change a thing.
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Very smart indeed.
Yes. John wants it.
But, Father, it IS!
We never went to bed together.
Why?
Goodbye, Aud...
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
Then let go!
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Really.
Well, how d'you think I feel?
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
Yes... oh, yes...
Looting and pillaging, eh?
About NOT raping you...
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Come on, move it!
What's it all about?
Row! Row! Row!
You may need a real Berserk.
ROW!
Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
Well, come on!
Oh... er... yes...
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
No, it is NOT.
I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
That's it!
Oh...
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
My brother blacksmiths!
How can we stops him now?
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
But it's a responsibility...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
I must KILL! Kill!
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
Me too.
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
Just a little overworked, maybe.
I told you that later.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
In the room?
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
It's okay, really.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I don't have one.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
I'm Joel.
I'm not nuts.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Yes?
Yeah?
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
Cheers.
Yeah?
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
You'll call me, right?
Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
Let's talk about it later.
I don't think we're ready.
You're not ready.
Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
I'm right here.
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
Come up and see me... now.
Yeah?
Not yet. Not married.
I remember that speech really well.
Probably.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Okay.
Female.
It's freezing out here.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Yeah.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
You must have been crazy.
Hi.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
No. I just need some space, maybe.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Oh! Great. That's great!
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
Sorry. I just --
Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
'kay.
Where?
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
You are such a sweetheart.
I have a family, Mary.
Well, where was Patrick?
Oh dear.
Then check the connections.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
You don't?
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
Bonanza Jellybean?
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
I'll be all over it.
What about the accumulator...?
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
It gets worse.
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
Pressure?
He's crashing...
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
Does he know that?
The dark inside me.
How do you know all this?
Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
Crystallized.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
It's complicated...
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
The Core...!
Justin just tried to kill himself. The man is clearly insane.
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
What makes you think I'll miss?
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
What is that?
Something like that, yeah.
Love to.
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
Captain, we got a problem.
Now what?
I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
I know that.
Justin's in the airlock.
We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...
DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
Keep him talking.
Come on, Baby-bear, open this door...
I'm alright. Please.
It means nothing.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
Relax, it's casual.
Victor did.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
Victor must've taken him.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
O-kay. We'll skip that question.
Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Ben, are you there?
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Okay, "mom."
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Later. First, I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
Never better.
Yes, thanks.
Which was?
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
What...?  Oh.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like --
All right!!
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Well... it's true.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
All right, then. It's your secret.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Come on...
How about both of us at the same time?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
Wow. I've been looking for that thing! Hey, Damone, have you met Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike Damone.
Okay. See ya.
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.
He is.
Naw. Any good?
Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot.
He was hot, wasn't he?
You'll always remember your first time.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
No.
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
But what are you going to do?
Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
You're gonna flunk me?!
All right, the point it is.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
We keep them.
We keep them, in case the people come back.
Yeah. It's my sister's.
Do you really have to go?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Not where we operate.
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
Don't worry...  ...and I'm actually the District Attorney from Ignoto County.  Just another good American like yourself.
What?
Damn right!
My heart!
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
He told me he was turning in early...
What tape?
You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands?
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
No! I swear I'm not!
I don't know what you're talking about!
Anyone.
Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
Easy.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
Fuck you too.
Why don't you go check it out?
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Really?
Okay then.
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
He's dead.
Covered.
No shit.
Right.
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
Putting on my armor.
Oh. I mean, good.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Without me.
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
No?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em?
...I see.
Really?
See you next weekend, Dad.
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
You really want to go?
Of course.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know.
When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
Good.
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Harry.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
What happened to him?
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
Forget it.
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
Calm down, Frances.
What for?
Beats me.
You're coming.
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --
Fine!
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
Mama, what's...
You kill me, Mama.
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
What's wrong?
Yes, Mama.
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders...  ...and your pencils...  ...and your god-damn buttons...  ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
You drove him to his torment.
Kill me and have done with it.
Kill you? Hardly that.
More to the point, why am I here? What did you want with me?  What does one say to one's Maker, having finally met him face to face? Milton gave it voice.  Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me Man? Did I solicit thee from Darkness to promote me?
This was not taken from a grave.
There, there... shhh...
So have I
Nothing can. Not ever.
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
God took her from us.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
No, no, they're all dead...
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
I can't, Barry...
Thanks.
You? The brick?
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
Twenty-eight.
Vamanos!
I have no idea.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
What's this about, money?
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
My wife.
Yes.
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
Why not, against your religion?
He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
Okay.
Daddy's dead.
Not many.
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
Six-fifty.
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
Cops.
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
What the fuck is she doin' there?!
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?
They broke when you fell.
When we get to El Ray, I'll take care of it.
That's how you're lookin', Richie.
It don't look together.
Yeah, it's mine.
Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.
What'd you find, Kathy?
Of course, but there's more --
No, sir.
"We'll all have lunch."  Good idea. Oh, and let's be sure to invite this sociologist, too -- just in case we want to have a FUCKING BRIDGE GAME AFTERWARDS!
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
Sir?  What did he say?
Hey.  Ain't your call, man.
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Uh, ma'am.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Absolutely not.
I'll work on it, ma'am.
Do that.
'Snot me.  It's him.
... two... one... MARK!
Come on, Montgomery...
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
I oughtta report you.
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
Just a coincidence?
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
How hard they making it on you?
I saw an article...
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork.
What about him.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
If you got a good one, Wick...
That's a good story.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
You got anybody, Wick?
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
Just askin'
What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --
Smoke it!
Maybe half.  Not even.
Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead.
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
"Dad."
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
Darth Vader reads poetry...
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
I take it this file is still open.
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
This is what you get for brain- picking an old CIA spook.  but if I needed to control the outcome of this test case, that's how I'd do it.  A man-in-place.  Makes everything very controllable.
Well, I can be tough if I want.
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
What?
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
Are you sure?
Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
Mr. Caiman...
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
Not now. You got my bag?
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
Are you sure? How do you know?
We know.
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
I'm sorry, sir, I was only-
Thanks.
Right... Sorry, sir.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
"Just!?"
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
Nothing.
Shut up.
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
It's okay. Listen-
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help.
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
GO Commander.
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
What's the weather like outside?
The enemy is matching velocity.
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
Yeah, what is it?
No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
Hey, YOU want to drive?
I think he just likes pointing at things.
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
It helps.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
We pretend...
Simpler.
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
As you wish.
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
Anything.
Pedal to the metal...
Fire at will. hI~D  NT. PROTECTOR
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
That can't be.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
Therefore, retreat.
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
Lafayette is my friend!  He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he's a child.  But he would have died before he would have let me down.
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
Makes you gag.
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
Chose another.  Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses.
Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
I don't want to see your hospital.
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
But not more than your comfort.
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes...
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
Let's get you darker!
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
I see...
This, this is life indeed!  Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now.
You see that? The way the man just went right over?
You guess? You mean you don't know?
Plan B. Here ya go, honey...
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
Yayo. Where is he?
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
What?
Bear, you're not really gonna –-
You positive about that?
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
I'm working on a few things.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
Leo, I don't know.
The airport.
What I been wondering is where's he been.
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Look at me, Ray.
Leo spanked a waitress?
Not really.
Harry, look at me.
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
Let's see how we get along.
Hey, Harry.
You have it?
We talk different?
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
With what? Wiseguy money?
Martin, look at me.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
How'd you know I was here?
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
You broke in?
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
Right. See how your story ends.
There a part in it for you?
And you think the movie business is any different?
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
You don't act like it?
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
I'm going into the movie business.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Hm?
Harry, are you going down, or you want me to?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
Oh, yeah, sure.
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
What? You sure?
Lemme see.
Damn mind of it's own.
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
Wrong. It's Friday.
Roger?
Yeah.
Maybe he isn't alone.
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
If you get it back in one piece.
How much longer's that gonna take?
Three, four days.
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
How about you Epps?
If they knew what they were carrying.
For starters, getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
I bet you did.
Hell yeah.
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
Who?
No. I'll try again later.
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
If it was a ship she hit.
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Not our mystery guest again.
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
Maybe it was more than that.
We hit land.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
Go.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
You've been out for about a day.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
Must be a little too the truth, eh Dodge?
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
How should I know?
Yup.
Are you still looking for a job?
Are you going to yell at me?
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
No, really I --
What are you trying to say?
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
I see... interesting...
Did you actually do this painting?
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
...wow...
I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --
It's not optional!
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
Hi.
Why?
Yeah, right...
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
Why do you have that stupid poster?
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Hey Josh.
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
Just look at them!
That lets us off the hook.
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
Somewhere downtown.
Fuck you, bitch!
What? Where?!
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
That rules!
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
Get away from me!
Fuck it. Everything must go!
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
What happened to Seymour?
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
When was this?
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid. 
Who does?
I thought it wasn't for sale.
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
Later, "Dude".
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
C'mon, Seymour, please?
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
Never...
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
I... I don't think so.
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
I had to see you.
What's up?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
What about this?
Jesus, how can you stand her?
I'm just being realistic.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
Yeah, well I like you too...
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
They're Seymour's.
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
No problem.
Talk to us about it...
Right, exactly!
She's not at home?
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
Well, I need to speak to him.
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
Have you got that in writing? 
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
Possibly.
Got me out of trouble.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
But of course yours worked.
Don't they have to be?...
Was that supposed to make me feel better? 
Good luck.
Why?
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
You've known him long?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
We don't have a relationship.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
Oh no.
Do you ever see him?
No.  Not that I can recall.
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
Thank you, Frank.  I'll get the hang of this eventually.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
His name is Oscar.
Oscar!  You poor kid!
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
You're really good, you know.
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
Peter, what about the bathtub?
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Same difference.
Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.
Oh, sure, that sounds great.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
My pleasure.
I await the word of Vigo.
You've got to stop them.  Please!
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
You were the one who got me in.
Okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
Well don't think!
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
Ummm -- figure eight?
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
That's a violin concerto.
No?  What do I act like?
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
On a purely scientific basis.
Okay, okay.  But if anything else happens, you have to promise you'll call me.
Goodbye.
You heard it?
You're the best one in your row.
Who's the stiff?
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
I want you inside me.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
What is it?
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Here are tonight's calls.
Oh, really?  Well, I've quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
Has this ever happened before?
Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
Are you Peter Venkman?
Then my theory was correct.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Why not?
You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to, but don't let him leave,  He could be very dangerous.
She said he was "the Destructor."
Full-stream with strogon pulse.
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
That appears to be the case.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
No sense worrying about it now.
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
It's not good, Pete.
What?  What popped in there?
Look!
Me, too.
LATER, MAN!!
That's what you told me two days ago!
I'm sure, I don't know.
What are you talking about?
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
Not yet, dear brother...
Apparently my opinion wasn't needed.
Until your confirmation date.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
Death is... everything for me.  Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well.  I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow!  I want all my gladiators to win and be happy!  Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before.
-- to fight?  We'll see...
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
Was I?
Yes.
Are you going to graduate school?
But could I just tell you this one thing?
Wait a minute.
Of course not.
You do?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
I've never been to it.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
Yes.
Why wouldn't it?
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Yes I am.
Yes, I will.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
I'd rather not.
I'll be there in an hour.
The Singleman party, sir?
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Whatever you say, sir.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
Right.
Why not?
What do you mean?
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
What's wrong?
No.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Very much.
Benjamin?
Will you unzip my dress?
But they would! Don't you see?
Thank you for taking me home.
I haven't. No.
Do you want me to get it?
Yes.
The number.
What?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Don't you?
Neither.
You're not interested in art?
I don't.
I don't remember.
There!
Him?
Always?
The driveway's on my side of the house.
Well how long has this been going on.
Is it?
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Well, wait a minute. You married him.
See if you can guess.
Are you shocked?
Yes.
Really. I want to know.
So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.
But why shouldn't I?
Yes.
Did I say that?
You don't have to say that.
Well don't thank me, because I want you to.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
Go home now.
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
Hey -- I don't get it.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
Well, wait.
You got me.
No. She doesn't know about it.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
I know.
But why?
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
Have you got that skeleton key?
No -- no -- no -- no...
I don't like your tone.
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
You?
Oh -- work!!
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
You live here?
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
Yes -- I do understand.
No.
That is not the truth.  You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it. 
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
Yes -- yes -- yes.
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
If I could get into a game I might win some.
If we could scare up some men to play.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
Yes, I was in the war.
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money.
If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
No, Doctor.
No, doctor.
Oh!
Send his bags up to my room.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
The Grand Hotel.
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
Everything?
I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.
Oh, don't go.
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
...weight into the balance...
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
Yes --
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
I wish to be alone.
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
Have I kept you waiting?
I know -- I know.
But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me -- 
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
Bobo, no, I --
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You'll never shit right again.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
These machines -- They're in here.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
Well, uh... No.
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Nice to see you.  What am I doing in here?
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
How come?
Get off the grift, Roy.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute, tell me what happened. Sit down.
Just a few bucks.
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
At what?
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
No.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Look at me.
You do. And once I'm out of here, I'll remind you of the best parts.
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
You already went back to work.
Oh, come on, Roy.
The long end. Big con.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
No; history. Sooner or later, the lightning hits. I don't want to be around when it hits you.
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.
Charming.
Care to join me?
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
My god...
Pretty messy.  Parents have already been notified.  Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
No shit?!
You're kidding with that answer, right?
It's an option.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
I can't afford to get caught.
I guess.  It's just hard to believe.
I'm okay.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
Shit happens.
Yeah.
Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing.
Why?  You interested?
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
We can light our own tree at home.
Then they can watch.
The voice man!  He's here!
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
Why did you take Jamie?
Samhain.
I'm sorry, but do I know you --
No one.
You know what gets me?
Um.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
What'll you do for transportation?
How about breakfast, wife?
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
I didn't know we had any women left.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
You're so low!  Look at that beautiful red meat.  You haven't touched it.
You did?
Everybody thinks that.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Blue soup.
That can be arranged.
What?
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Hello.
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Where's Mom?
She has a master's degree in English literature.
England?
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Penelope!
Will you go to bed?
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
Who was it?
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
Gee whiz, Dad--
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
Eighteen--  and a half.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
Nothing would please me more.
Thank God!
You used to like it stark!
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
I could eat a raw baby crocodile.  The way to get your wife back is in bed.  Do such a job on her that she'll be lucky if she can crawl around on all fours.  We're starving.  Do you mind?
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
Fish can't feel.
Yes.
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
I rang.  It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
I mean it!
There it is.  Give it to me.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
I'm a neighbor.  I have the apartment across the hall.  I have to go to the hospital now.  An emergency.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
And her fiancé!
I won't try to keep up with you. I'm not as fast on my feet as I once was.
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
You were wrong, you quack!
What for?
There's a certain amount of information there.
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
Yes.
You haven't heard me yet.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
Thought you were another wife, maybe.
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
I don't care what she wears.
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
I don't want to live any more.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
I didn't know that.
It's beautiful.
Then who flushed the toilet?
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
He isn't?
Doing what?
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
I'm touched.
They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, "Happy Birthday, Somebody Else."
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
What kind of a life is that?
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
How neat.  How keen.
Or get eaten alive.
Phooey.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
Big threat. TV would ream you.
You'll be fine.
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
No, I don't.
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
We offer...
Man, how many girls do you need?
Yeah.
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Up front?
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
You know what I'm talking about.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
Yeah, yeah, go on.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Shit.
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
Well, what do they know?
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
Mr. Van Dorn?
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
What are you paying me for?
I'll be there.
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
No.
Hmm.
Does she know anything about this?
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
Okay.
They're all about the same. You want something?
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
To his own daughter?
The guy who bought you that ring.
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
How long have you been driving?
Lady, let me get this straight.
Hello.
Out!
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
Check.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
No, thank you. I have my car.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Oh, look! The birds.
All right.
It goes on and on.
Look.
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
Well, don't go.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
Maude.
Oh, Harold. 
Farewell?
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
I'm getting married.
Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Does that worry you?
Why?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
Would you care to talk about this friend?
Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Yes.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
She certainly has.
I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
What are you talking...
Nonsense, I...
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
The Cenobites.
Story of my life.
I'm lucky that way.
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
No. It's not.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Who wards off demons.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
Who?!
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
Don't move. We --
I'm in charge. We go back!
Father's back?  Still angry?
Hey. You: think twice --
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
"Need" is a good, solid word.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Not hungry.
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
...Polo.
Strong.
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
It'll go in.
Do you really need this bed, lady?
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
Stay the fuck away from me.
This isn't happening.
Some things have to be endured...
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
I said: don't look.
Tell me who you are.
What do you want me to do.
One more. Maybe two --
Who?
The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.
You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse...
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
Who did?
Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
There's a towel in the bathroom.
This afternoon.
We'll move in Sunday.
So damn stupid.
I'll be scarred for life.
Are you O.K.?
Fine.
You want something to drink?
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
Yeah, why don't I?
What did you say?
Do you want me to come over?
Steve?
It's like she's waiting for something.
I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.
Finished?
Show her.
I AM house-trained.
Your father told me you were working here.
As long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
Don't let them take me, Steve --
I won't let anybody take you.
Long time ago.  I was just thinking about her.  I was her first boyfriend.
That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."
"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Suck my ass.
What the fuck is that?
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
No, you can't.
I have a television.
-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Where's Rob?
Nice friend.
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Uh...yes, at the moment.
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Huh?
Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
I'll tape it for you.
-- FUCK OFF!
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Hi.
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
What's the obvious stuff?
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
Is it better?
I don't know.
Never?
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
Well, think about it.
I can't talk right now.
Who the fuck's Pig?
Mmnn.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
Hi.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
What about Ian?
Okay.
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
I know.
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
Are you persuadable?
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
You called this morning?
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
Good.
I understand completely.
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
God, you ask a lot of questions.
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
But you must have --
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
Fine.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
Records are those big round black things, right?
Maybe he's hiding from something.
How old is Richard?
Fine.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
Probably.
People like that rarely leave business cards.
Why not?
Dupont Circle.
Not your concern.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
He was innocent.
Have you gone to the police?
Go home.
You had to do _nothing_!
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
There are differences.
I haven't killed _you_.
Is that a threat?
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
All of it finished.
Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
It'll never stick.
Aye.
Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
How can you know this?
You are the same?
It is less.
Not even a single lifetime.
This is madness!
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
Me father has taken back my hand.
Do what you must.
Romirez is dust.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
We need more time.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
We have no understanding.
He's a MacLeod.
My father taught me.
Yeah.
No.  I want this to be all ours.
Sit.
You're insane.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
Of sorts.
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
He was carrying a Syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever.
The resemblance is amazing.
Same.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
Hello, Bensinger.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
Of course!  Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff.  How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
Bon jour!
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
The five hundred? Sure.
The check, Bruce!
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
Out some place.
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.

I feel I ought to take care of her.
I'm beginning to realize that.
So long.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
Get out of here, you!
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
What home?
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
What's his line?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
You're not afraid, are you?
Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.
You said it.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
What do you mean?
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
What did you do with her?
Was she? Did you notice?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Yes.
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Thanks.
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
A lot of money.  Four hundred and fifty dollars --
It's a deal. Let me up.
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
Me, too.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
Okay.  Up you go, Mollie.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
Just coffee.  And you, sir?
Good coffee, isn't it?
He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
Yeah. But I --
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
Fred!
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
I was just going to!
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
I can't.
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
Five hundred dollars.
Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Where's the money?
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Isn't that her picture?
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Well, maybe you think I could!
There's somethin' funny going on around here.
Ssh!
What's from the Governor?
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
We want to see you.
She and Mollie were talking.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
Who told you that?
They're not.
Do you know any swear words?
Sod.
They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.
Ask her yourself.
Who with?
Pauline.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
Who pays for them?
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
I mean, no suspenders. They just kinda' disappear up your ass.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Propaganda. We've been had.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
They'd gone.
What's that?
It looks....foreign.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
What are you going to be then?
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Where to?
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
How are we going to cope?
Wasn't it lovely?
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
You might still have a house.
Father, that's enough now
And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness.
How long?
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
Huh... what cone?
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
No, I told you...
Come on.
A dead one.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
You know... a couple of queers.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
Thanks.
No problem.
Turn that fucking radio off!
There's a dog in the road.
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement. He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook.
Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
Why?
So what?
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Exactly... well, I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
That's the understatement of the year.
Huh?
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
No, just a little too old.
Oh, it's real... as real as I want it to be, mamma...  ...look, see the magic in my brush strokes.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
I pray to God there is.
Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
What.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
French?
Oui, doctor, oui.
Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here.
You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
Yes. Happy happy.
But I don't know how to leave Lila.
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you.
That's not how he tells it.
I don't know. Something's missing.
Oui.
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
Okay.
It's okay, Puff.
What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Yeah. My brother told me.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Oh, Rosie.
I'm sorry?
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
Nathan!
That's a great idea.
Yes, darling.
Flares?
Actually, I just had an amusing thought.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
I guess.
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Absolutely!
Should I come with?
Ummm. It's good.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Ugnh.
Unn.
Mm hmm.
Twelve thousand.
Cut.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
Yeah. Sure, sure.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
In that case, you owe me another drink.
Eddie, you're a born loser.
I told you. I got drunk.
To do what?
Seventy-five per cent.
For who?
Now, when did you adopt me?
Hi. How's business?
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
I don't know. Never saw him play. They say he's one of the best.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
How're the hands?
They're fine.
All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Yeah, that's right.
Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
Nobody can make that shot and you know it. Not even a lucky lush.
Fast and loose, man.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
I want you to come back on the road with me.
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
Oh yeah? Where?
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
Lay down and die by yourself. Don't take me with you.
Bert, I believe Mr. Felson's making a proposition.
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Okay?
Half and a dollar.
Ten dollars.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Call it.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
No.
Well, what do you want to know? And why?
You got it all in your head?
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
What did all this stuff cost you?
Raw.
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
Me. It's Eddie.
Well, what else does?
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Come here. Come on, now.
I'll be up later.
Just for luck.
Is that a fact?
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
You name it.
Have you always had it?
I don't know.
Who?
I don't know.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Yes.
Yes.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
What did it look like?
That's a doozy of a dream, son.
I was so scared.
It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
We were having a little talk.
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
Can you tell me about that?
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
This shows how to get to my home. I'm giving you back roads and footpaths, so there's less chance of you being seen.
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
Oh?
What's his family background?
They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
Connie, don't hang up.
Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
He's not going to listen to me.
Did it work?
I'll bet.
Haven't you been watching?
That signal. It's a countdown.
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
They don't know this.
Dad...
We'll meet you there.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
ETA with target; four minutes.
Then find them.
Roger.
No Sir. Definitely not.
Be careful.
Butt-munch.
I know, you like to make a big entrance.
I should have done this a long long time ago.
He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
I hear you.
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
So push it!
You sure?
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
Die.
And I am his.
Yes. My treat.
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
Tapestries?
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
Yes?
I usually don't.
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
Mine, too.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
So it did.
You do.
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Thank God!
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
There were rats, Dad.
Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
Will you take it easy!
I'm out, Dad!
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
Brody's this way.
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
I was the next man.
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
A long time to wait.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
Where's my father?
You think so?
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
Oh -- good. And maybe the present Maharajah is a little younger? And thinner?
I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
Yes, I understand.
Step on it, Short Round!
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
Behind you!
Two are still missing.
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
You will go to palace there.
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
He told me they knew I was coming here.
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
What?!
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
Maybe he likes older women.
Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen.
I'm...inside you.
Me.
Who?
Yes.
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
Who am I?
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
You're gonna explain.
Yeah.
I'll talk to them.
Yeah...Who is?
I did. I brought you back here.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
I'm not leaving until you do.
Go out, take your first left.
Just walk down the hall?
With Authority!
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
That's not a good idea.
Gone where?
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
Send a man there. A secret agent.
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
I don't have any.
I can't do that.
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
The beach.
Just get there.
Little late for that.
Eat it.
I don't want to eat it.
It's sand.
Follow it.
What?
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
...Rene...
It worked.
What are you looking at?
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct...
You shut down your sensors.
What she say. What'd you get out of her?
Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.
Run, stupid!
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
I was afraid of that.
Yeah, sure.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
That's nice.
It's all we've got.
Then what?
Rene?
What about it?
It may have been affected.
Well what?
I don't know Who.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Been hearing voices.
Sir?
What do you want?
...I'm looking for someone.
No. No one to speak of.
Where?
...right here too.
...I...don't know.
Can I help?
You are.
That you're not crazy.
You're talking to me.
You're doing...Okay.
Just Okay...
That depends...
Why did they leave?
I'm sorry. What will you do?
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
You've  been there?
I know the territory.
Can you?
That I really don't know.
Nothing we can do.
I knew it. I told him.
...Piece of mind.
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
A drink...
Why?
You can't take that.
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
It will.
Too much.
Three hours.
I'll be there.
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
Sure.
Good.
Oh, I love that stuff.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Is this "Alice in Wonderland"?
Call me back in ten.
Why?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
Why? Who said?
What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
Who's calling?
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
What?!
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
I got perspective.
...you fucked me!
Who is this?
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
All right. See you...
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
What "Seven Dwarfs?"
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
How have you liked your stay?
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else.
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action.
Jeff...
What?!
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
ABC Telemarketing Company.
That's bullshit, Jeff!
You try and have a good time.
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
Well, what do you really think, though?
Someone put a bullet in my mailbox.
Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh?
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system.
It acts as a...
...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
They hate each other --
So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
Howard!
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Triple!
Grounds?
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
Got any symptoms?
What?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
Well... I'm still...
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
Yes?
Ruth Rabino.
I'll be right back.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
Did you see the tape?
How do you know?
He wants a reconciliation.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
But why him?
I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
Your mother was.
Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
I have a watch.
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
May I come in?
I want to nail you ass.
What kind of "stuff?"
Please! Leave the house.
You do? You do love me?
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
So where are you now?
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
My client has ruled that out.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
Did Marylin end up with money?
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
Ah.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
And she had private investigators assisting her.
Nothing.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
Is she going through with it?
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Mother?
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Muriel Rumsey.
"I found a million dollar baby—"
Who said anything about a reward!
Do you love her?
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
Oh, come now—
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
Any others?
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
You win!
Well—of all the—well—  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
My ticket?
Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
You must have me confused with—
Shut up!
All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike. 
The pleasure is all mine.
Like this. I have no robe.
Hey—you're little, aren't you?
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
What?
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
Oh, Peter— 
was so scared—that it scared—
There's no end to your accomplishments.
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
Sorry, Miss.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
But can't you wait until morning—
Okay. I was just trying to make conversation.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Huh?
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office—unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
Get out!
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
Who's she gonna marry?
I'd put you there myself.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
Okay, pete. 
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
I ain't got a hat.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is—"  No, do you really?
Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
Yeah.
Zeke.  Git!
Yes, Ma.
Thanks. 
Why?
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
Why—no—
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
Sure—sure—I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Did he pay?
Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish I had a million of those bimbettes.
And Oswald?
Senator Long set your boss up, my friend.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
What's the other name?
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.
Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
I think we should have him in for a little talk.
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
No, I did not.
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
And then Sunday?
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
Your Honor, I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question. Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck?
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
How many shots you say you heard?
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
We're going back into the case, Lou - the murder of the President.  I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people.  Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records...
A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
Never touched me.
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
That's it.
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
Yes?
I mean it. I don't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries.
I won't forget.
Who?
A bit.
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
What time do you have to be there?
Take your time.
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
It's not really something I think about.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
Surprise.
"American President"
How was it?
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
I'm old enough to be her father.
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
Has he hinted around?
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Not every day?
We can look into that.
You two meet?
Was she there?
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
But you didn't do that.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
So what happens now?
You positive about that? You weren't nervous and let something slip by mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I just gotta know.
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
No, I give it to someone else first.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
Four days ago.
How long?
Really, I'm impressed.
What's a Metrix?
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
You been to Japan?
Lemme have the bag.
You sure?
Okay, Lou-is.
That's good money.
I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
I'm in my underwear.
She believed you?
Go in there, snatch her by the hair, and drag her big ass out. This is my goddam money we're talking about. Get your ass out the door.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
Not now, pick me up.
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
Where did you shoot her?
You said five hundred and fifty!
Then what?
We went to the parking lot.
Maybe the Feds got it.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
You gonna tell me who it was?
They don't have your winning personality.
I need your name and address.
Brown, Jackie Brown.
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
Falsely accused? She didn't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her?
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
Winston found you.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
In a way, yes.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
She's all alone.
Try not to rip his clothes off 'em they're new.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
Yeah, ever since that ...
You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.
It's short, huh?
He was upset. He thought people were following him.
You need ... a doctor.
Used you?
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
A couple of weeks, I think.
You ever read Meister Eckart?  How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?  Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side.
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
I'm walking, aren't I?
Jake, you need to rest.
Likewise.
But I see them.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
What's your name?
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
It's freezing.
She was good in bed, though.
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
We're at Della's.
Show me Della!
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
Coming here?
Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
Here. I'll do it.
Am I home?
You're right here, Jake. You just rest.  The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate.  Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up.
I know.
He did? When?
I can do anything I want.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
Where are they?
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise.  A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
That's what they called it. A fast trip right down the ladder.  Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. But I don't need to tell you. You know.
Never?
Pleasant dreams.
Just relax.
I know. That's why I'm asking.
That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
He'll never make it.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Help me!
Of course it is. What else could it be?
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
They're waitin' for me, that's why.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
Everywhere, like a plague.
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
You come home with me.
A car accident.
Speaking of which, duck!
We don't have a choice!
We made it?
What?!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
Guys!!! The shuttle?
No you don't!
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
You?
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
Did you like it?
You're leaving me here alone?
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
Am I in there?
Oh, alright.
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
Thirty seconds.
I gotta go back.
But?!!
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
Obviously so.
Nanotechnology.
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
Are you finished?
Old Earth?
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
I know who he is...
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
I almost had 'im.
The bilge pumps. There --
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
I never hear the whistle.
Older, sillier.
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
My kids were on that beach...
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute. 
You could say that.
How can you tell?
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
Why don't we just tow it in?
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
I can't imagine why.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
I've got all these signs here...
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
I don't know...
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Or something.
I try really hard, actually...
It does?
I don't really know anything about it.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
I'm a junior.
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Viscera?
Oh.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
What?
It's just not working out, but I'm getting my own place in the city... and I've got it all planned out. It's something I've wanted to do for a long time...
No?
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
You should try Adderall.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
Yeah, like people in love.
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
That is sick, man.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
Well, you are kind of... convex.
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
A hotel?
Adele for god sake please lis...
That French ain't it?
You can?
It's a portfolio of my work.
What's Early been in jail for?
Early, sing me a song.
Walter Livesy.
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
Yeah?
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
...I do.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
Lighten up...
Carrie.
She told me...  ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail?
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
Why, what did he do?
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
No, thanks, I can manage.
No.
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
Yes. Altogether.
Were they wearing condoms?
Was up bitch?
How?
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
Probably.
He lives on 76th?
Yeah.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
Yeah.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
So.
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
Why not? You stink.
Casper, where's Telly.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
You sure?
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Hold on.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
Yeah. I can understand that.
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
Come on.
Of course I do.
No, Fidget, I...
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
What?
One.
What?
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Yep.
Yeah.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Not too late.
It's me. Telly.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
What?
You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
Homesearchers.
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
Why not?
If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
You're not going to tell me that.
Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
Let me speak to my daughter.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
No problem.  We're in.
What scars?
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
You're losing me.
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
Any sign of rape?
It's important.
I would think it's some type of clue as to where he's going to kill next?
What did he mean by Huxley?
What does that mean?
The most logical choice.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
"Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
He uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  Singular.  Not can't move us.
Is it serious?
Feel like practicing?
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Uh huh.
Yes.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
It seems like such a complicated game.
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Getting too hot in here for you?
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
Do you?
Because I work with them.
She died in a car accident.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?
What?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
But I do.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
I can't wait either.
Colwyn ...
I don't know how.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
Of course it was.
Turold's son was to marry her.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
I'm not sure.
Can she be forced?
Never.
I don't think that.
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
At the gallop!
Subject to the King, no doubt.
There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
Can't I come, too?
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
I don't think it's working.
Your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast, Magnificence.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
The new King.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
Yes.  Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
It is too late. He has drunk.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
You had a son.
Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
...Office 2702.
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... Banks are robbed every five minutes!
How can you say it?
What, for example?
No.
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
...17.
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
Yeah, what?
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
Huh? That's smart!
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
Where?
You'd be visiting me at Nasa.
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
It's just a regular day.
What?
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
That's all right isn't it?
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
In a hospital.
What?  Who are you?
It's yours.
This isn't right.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
No alcohol?
...Noooo.
No.
Water?
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
What do you mean?
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
No?
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
Yes... I'll give you that.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
How much, do you think?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Yuri... are you...
Go to hell.
I believe we are.
That's not what's important.
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
I guess.
I'm Elle Woods. Ms. Bonafante's attorney.
Huh?
Is everything okay?
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
What?
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
See?
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
How about --
Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.
I'm so happy for you!
Licensed attorney or family member?
Relation?
Name?
Delta. Gamma.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
Yes, he is.
So?
Power yoga?
Picking out my wedding dress!
What?!
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.
Oh, my God!!
Is he the only one?
Are you sure?
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
Well, in all likelihood, she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
Well, yeah, but --
Are you serious?
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
You should glory in your animal nature.  It is your triumph!  None know that better than I!
You... you're a beast!
And you... are you not also afraid?
Do you feed on mice and rats?
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
Flozen foleva not good.
There's a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it... and a silver key no lock can resist.
I'm in no mood for dancing.
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
There aren't enough arrows.
Fire away!
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
Mean you to seek him out below?
Patience, lad.
He'll not escape me.
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
Sorry.
If you like.
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
Shhh!
I don't want it on me.
Oh, la...
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
In the dark... where I join him...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Pinching me!
Pinching?  Where?
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
Dead, dead, dead.
What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
I'm promised to another!
What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
It's done... we'll never catch him.
You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
You've been inside?
We can work.
What's wrong?
You'd better call and cancel.
Oh God, we don't want the police!
I'll survive.
Nope.
Monday.
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
I don't know.
Tell him I said "hi".
No thanks.
I can use your mom's.
I'm coming in.
We're not gonna do anything.
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
I've been dreading you.
A violation?
Allowed outside the enclosed area.
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
That's too long.
For everything.
She's out with a friend.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
Nothing.  My dad's dying.  I really need to talk to Alyssa.
You have everything?
I almost saw Catalina.
Why?
You're so predictable.
You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
I don't know.
When are you going to be back?
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Oh, okay.
You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
What I'm not.
Nothing.
To hide a black eye.
After everything.
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
I know there's an explanation.
Three.
She's a little sad, is all.
Four days.  I left to think.
But you can't call me while you think?
I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.
When's school over?
I don't have a phone.
He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
I think so.
What did I say?
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
Not a perfect day.
You got any weed?
I'll make you something.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
Sooner than the Fall.
What?
You can't go because of Sam?
Please don't leave me.
Either do you.
Why?
No.
I locked the door!  Get out!  I locked the door!  Get out!
You could keep it and rent it out?
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
What did you say?
Dad said it first.
In the bedroom.
At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
Yes, boss.
I'll be right back.
Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back.
I don't think so.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
That jelly you were talking to right here?
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
Forget it.
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
Say what?
The hell you talking about? What train?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
Don't touch that car.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
You killed Santa Claus?
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
No problem. Oh, boy!
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
Don't worry about that. Hey, fellas, this here is my mama. These are some of my friends. That's Willie, there's Poker Face, Radio, Cookie, Goldmouth, Biscuit, Jangle Leg.
I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
Something like that, yes.
Shoot him, Wilkins!
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
I slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch. Help wash down all them pills they'll be giving you.
Blacks welcome there?
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
Absolutely not.
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
...their damned souls will be ours.
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
Yeah, you do...
It would be so okay.
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
That pain is hunger.
Well, let's rock and roll.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.  You get your ass back up there. You save your father!
That's a pretty brassiere.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
Yeah. You do it.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
See ya, fellas.
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
Really?
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
From my dad's side of the family.
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
Off limits.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
I don't know.
See something you like, my man?
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
Thanks.  I thought you'd be older. I expected a Red.
Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
Please... No.
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
I'm listening.
K.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
Maybe you'll think of something...
You're not going, are you?
Uh-uh.
Let's see -- how long has it been?
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
You know, Jessica.
Then the answer's yes...
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
Things change!
No.
What people?
What kind of place is this?
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
And all alive you say?
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
Too little.
Good... You up for a drive?
Okay.
You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
Pile in.
How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Or not so recently?
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
Andy?
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
Alice?
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
What night is that?
Sit down.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Did you tell the police this?
What's the word on the street?
Yeah, Mack?
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
What night?
Called? When?
He's got some fucked up friends.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
I can see that.
Pornos?
You know who it is.
You want some company?
What night?
Whatiya mean?
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Oh, read it!
I'm a paleontologist.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
Do you think they're cannibals?
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
Please don't call me Lovey.
I'm thinking.
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
Sounds like a stall to me.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
Horns? What kind of horns?
Come on, Lovey.
Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
Think of it! In times like these.
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
You mean you don't want to go?
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
When was all this?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
No.
Now, what would you like to do?
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
Then it's done.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Are you so certain you are away from it?
How can we get in touch with them?
I thought so!  He tells everyone I'm old. He wants them to stay away from me. He can't stand it when anyone comes near. He's punished me for every minute I've spent with George. If it weren't for him, I would have been out of here long ago, but he always stops me. Six months ago, I tried to escape and he locked me in a dark room. I nearly went crazy.  Look at me, Mr. Conway, do I look like an old woman? Is this the skin of an old woman? Look into my eyes and see if these are the eyes of an old woman?
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
Yes.
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
You talk as though you intend on staying.
That's what you said.
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
Yes, the little Russian girl.
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
What was that?
What do you suggest?
That was easy. I read your books.
A man whose life was empty!
Yes, I know.
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
Why, mother?
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
The hell were you thinking?
Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
What the hell...
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
And Goodwill Toward Man?
We're the government, Cowan.
Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too.  Dave.
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
Well this didn't.
I'd go with number three.
Don't worry about it.
INS, Washington.  Special services.
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
She didn't even know you. .
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
Where to?
How does that help me?
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
Do his job.
Kay!?
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
Actually, you may have.
Well, first of all, it's entomologist.
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
So... how did they get here?
Maybe you need a closer look.
I dunno. One?
It's... coming.
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
The what?
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
Where's he making his big speech?
Oh shit!
Don't tell me.  Insects.
That's why you have doors, Mr. President.  Keys, however, are to lock the doors.  And locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  Why? Fear.  You humans are afraid.  So you set up boundaries.  Borders. Your car.  Your home.  Your country.  All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  Well I am here to let that enemy go.  Because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  It's the border to the Universe.  And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  It was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  Until now.  Because I have been sent here to open the door.  To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN.    Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
What?
Agatha, you're never going back there.
What --
About who?
Right.  I know --
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
Whatever you say, John.
It's all I could safely move.
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
We know each other?
How do I find the --
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
Not to mention, "Saved by the bell".
Lara --
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
In the middle of the night?
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
I'm not getting halo'd.
Uh, sir...
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
We're in motion on something.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Yes, it is.
Yes.
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
Do I know you?  Who are you?
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
I guess that's all of it.
Uh, I'll try...
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
I wanted to.
Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
He's alive?
NO!
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
Kill me!
The what?
I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
The safest place of all.
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Not quite.
Yes.
What?
No, I wanna kill my boss!
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
There's thousands of units like this one.
Two?
We can stop him.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
Ah.  That must be why you look so nice.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
So you haven't seen his apartment?
It was nobody's fault.
But John was with him at the pool?
Yes.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
You sure? I just made it.
Then put my Martel's in a snifter.
Are you sure?
Look at, ladies. I could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. But I feel what you guys are putting out there. I'm only a mirror reflecting what I'm getting from you. And I'm saying yes to it. I'm shaking hands with it. I see the road that you're pointing down and I'm saying I'll ride shotgun. And when your foot slams on the accelerator, I won't get scared. I'll stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. With my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'Faster, Billy! Faster! Drive faster! Faster yet -- !'
But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
Uncle Bobby?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
How could you let her see this?
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Get away from her.
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
Where is this happening?
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
Brooklyn.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
How so?
Sure. Yeah.
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
Why?
What?
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
So, that's it. I'm out?
No.
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Good morning.
I didn't tell him shit. He worries too much. I love that old Jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. We started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
He's not here.
Any time, bro.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I gotta pick up the baby.
I like it.
Who's driving her?
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
Pretty nice.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
You got that right.
Where?
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
C'mon, man...
The what?
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
You're out of money?
Eighty.
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Tom. How's it going?
Bobby and Ricky.
Well, come on then. It's back here.
You see a Ricky Slade?
You look good, man.
Cool. See you later.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
I hear the China Club is a laugh.
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
We're square.
Keys.
What?
Yeah. That fernet tastes like tar. My grandfather tried to give me that.
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
And where might that be?
A rose by any other name would --
Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
I keep all my numbers in my head. I've never written any down.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
Now.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
I ain't said I'm ashamed.
You the only cat don't come on with that "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss none.
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue- eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
No, Brother Minister.
If you want to tell me.
How do you like it?
What have you set your mind to?
I know.
What do you think?
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our people know what I'm doing.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
I told you we don't know for certain.
'Bout every other night, Red.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
500.
Well, all reet, then.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
I ain't doing bad.
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had twenty-five grand in his pocket.
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
He's bright.
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
[Why?]
Where?
[The boss did or his brother.]
[Who's the boss?]
[Ordered by who?]
[I believe you.]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
I don't know, but I know his face.
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[And I had my men ready.]
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
I came to visit you.
Different door. Not far from here.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
I know. But which state?
I'm looking for potential.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
No.
Not at all?
But why not?
Well, I let him go.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
Where?
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
Don't worry. You will.
Yes.
You don't drink like you used to.
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
Never.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
It's Creasy.
What was her name?
Camila. Camila Valencias.
[OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.]
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
Yeah, sure.
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
Where?
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
I came to see you. How you feel?
It's her baby too, you know.
She gave me the evil eye.
When was this?
What they say?
Were the lights on?
That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
Benjamin Franklin, where's that? Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt right up here on Fordham Road. It's right arounna corner from my house. I have a cousin who's a teacher. He teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. He was studying to be a Jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows.
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
Well, that's what I was saying. My father is getting old. And we're very close. He's a wonderful man, really...
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you. I'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or I'll call you up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be so afraid.
Oh, I'm fine.
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
We just live one flight up.
I came up to dance, wadda you think? You here with somebody?
I'm just here with another girl.
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
Sure. This girl said...
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
I heard you, Ma.
She looks thirty-five, forty. She didn't look Italian to me.
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
Right.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
On accounta...
I'm gonna see you tonight...
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
How you, Radar?
Home.
That's right.
He said it for us all, Walt.
Look at that right eye.
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
You make a mean martini, kid.
Perfectionist.
The spot we picked to spend the winter. Maybe we ought to look a little harder.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...
Call Dago Red.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
Good thinking, Duke. How about it, Ho-Jon? Can you round up a few of the boys?
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Same here. You can retire my number.
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
...And for our Supreme Commander over here and our Commander-in-Chief in Washington.
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
What?
I think I heard about that.
Hawkeye's asking the Major's opinion on a point of anatomy.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
An eternal damnation.
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
Yeah, and he's lost a lot of blood. I'm afraid it's hit more that just the lung.
What do we do?
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
Our minds?
You're an attractive man.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
I didn't have much choice.
What's wrong with him?
Let's get his clothes off quick.
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
I don't think so either.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Oh, get out of here!
What's that, Henry?
Yeah?
Boys, we're home free.
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paper—and forty heads are chopped off!
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think—
Yes!
No.
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
John! I'm so glad to see you. I—I was terribly worried.
Oh.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
The Websters.
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
You bet I will, Ma.
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
The letter from John Doe.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
Awwwww!
Beany!
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
Well, anyway, I—I guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
It must be some kind of a gag.
Four bits.
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
How?
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Uh-huh.
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
What?
I didn't see anything.
No, sir.
I-it's all right, Mrs. Brewster. It was just a sea-gull.  Er. nothing's happened yet! No, I'm watching. Don't worry. Ju-just leave it all to me!
What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
Dinner's on you.
Yeah, okay.
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
That's right.
What's the suspect's name?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
Roper, we're into it...
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
For now that's all.
No. You just do shit for me right now.
Only at the very end.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
Yes.
What's the first commandment?
Why?
To save lives.
So what do you want?... An autograph.
The jockey!
We won.
About six years. My partner took me.
I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
So what do you want to do?
Is the hostage injured?
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
I worship you.
Greg.
Maybe you should be.
Something I guess I can't have anymore.
You think I didn't need you?
If you did, you never showed it.
Scottie...
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
SHIT!
What do you think would be in order?
I'll provide you with transportation.
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
Yeah, they are but...
From the dream.
In a computer program.
Not real?
Only up there in the dream they called life.
Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
There is no --
A hotel?
He wouldn't say.
Good question.
Corporation can.
Yes.
I know.
Not you.  A copy.
There was no other choice.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
Describe program function.
Destination?
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
Uplink selected.
Wait a second...  What time is it?
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
Now tell me... what do you see?
I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
... I just pray we're not too late.
Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!
In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies.  For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
You forgot to say 'Simon says."
What are ya tellin' me, Charlie?
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Charlie Luciano.
Tell me about it.
But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
How's Bugsy doin'?
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
You got something to hide?
Guess I'm too confused to think.
London?
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
How soon can we pull this off?
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
And the Jews?
Coming with me will be a delicate matter. We will work it out. But Charlie...
They do what I tell 'em.
Jesus.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
Five CC's.
Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
Death! Thank you!
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
...In some weird way I respect that.
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
YOU SET ME UP!!
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
I might wake up.
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
... What are they all doing there?
How are you doing sweetheart?
Behind the books.
But I was dusting.
Really?
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
Thanks very much, sonny--
I did not--
It couldn't be.
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
Certainly.  Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words--*Willet Creek*. When that happens--if my hunch is right--the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and Puss will jump out of his boots.
"There's more light here," he says--
My friends?
--followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
Mind, now! Keep Don Quixote out of here!
Okay--I mean--
Right now--everything I own--!
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State--  Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play *I'll* get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--!  Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
What is it?
Sam Foley--dead!
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Oh! Go away.
Washington! Always discussing the problems of Washington. Nobody ever thinks of the State--and my problems!  I *will* tell Jim Taylor. It's high *time* I told him a thing or two! 
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
Horace Mill--!
*Your* political future! I bought it for you and made you a present. And I can grab it back so fast it'll make your head spin. You got a nerve to stand there and worry about just *your future* when we're in this spot!  The man is--*Miller*.
Me! Jim--how--?
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Himself!
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
Uh--could--could I help--?
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
Look! There it is!
Goodnight, Miss Paine.
Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man called Taylor got to do with this?
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
Mr. President, have I permission to bring into this Chamber evidence of the response from my State?
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
No!
Did you say--bus?
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
I know--but you--you're going to help.
How?
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
It hasn't been easy, has it?
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Go right ahead.
Well, if it's all the same to you--
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Already? All these letters?
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
Saunders--!
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
Wait--
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Oh--Saunders--
Hurray!
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
Oh--you are!
That's--that's splendid.
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
Yes--
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Just a minute, Joe!
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
Yes.
Sometimes he whistles.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Your Honor!
Yes, but I—
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings. I'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff—
Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President—  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
Oh, that—
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
Gosh! What do you know about that!
You have?
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
All right.
Are you? When?
I'm crucifying him.
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
With pay!
With pay!
Is he really that big a sap?
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
Say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Shhh!
Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again!  I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office.
Fourteen carat?
Oh, yes sir.
A smaller bowl of flowers.
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to—
You're going to New York with us.
No, thank you.
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
Uh-huh.
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
What're you talking about?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing—
Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
We own an opera house, don't we?
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
Well, thanks, I - uh—  How do you do? What is your name?
What kind of wife did you say she was?
Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Don't pay any attention to her.
Farmer?
South Dakota - but on the top.
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
Very good, sir.  Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram came for you, sir.  I'll get you some black coffee, sir.
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
Me, sir?
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
Uh-huh. What are they?
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
Could you come with me please?
Why's that?
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
No, not really.
Not any more.
...And I from Phyllis.
It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order.
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
Right now?
My approach?
About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
Should I open it now?
Do you want to come in?
Doc. Nice to meet you.
You've done well.
Yes.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
Oh, I don't know...
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
What?
I think you do.
We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
Maybe you'll catch it.
Oh boy... this should be interesting.
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
Disgusting.
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
You like it?
Yeah?
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
Okay...
I think so.
I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
He agreed?
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman.
Well, there's Lily.
This --
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Really?
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
It wasn't the best situation.
You and Candy...?
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
English Lit.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
You're not going to kill us?
Excuse me?
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
Even?
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
You shall see.
Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book...  And your sister.
All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing.
Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
You will not believe it.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
No.
No?
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Oh that's comforting.
What are those mirrors for?
You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys.
Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
You lied to me!
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
What?
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
I know you knew I'd know.
So who killed him?
But they all had one thing we haven't got.
Let's do it.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
Thanks.
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
I got it.
What about Captain Amazing?
You underestimate yourself.
Really?
Me.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Curiosity.
I saw him walk you home.
Roy.
Alone tonight?
Sure.
What have they got that we ain't got?
You don't seem very angry right now.
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
I just know.
Because that's what it is.
There's a vague similarity.
Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand!
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Well they've crawled back out.
Not yet.
But... the silverware?
I use it... to fight evil.
Sorry.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
The bazookas?
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
Proceed.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
I'm glad you like it.
May I come to the map?
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
Any cannon?
There are none here.
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
But who made this treaty?
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
I suppose I might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall, but how can I?  She was on her own again, she had to look after her own affairs, and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of Kings?
No, sire... I was asleep.
Yes, sir, I am.
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Four o'clock.
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
Impossible, I don't believe it.
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
And you, Junot?
Only as a last resort.  What are the Councils doing now?
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
Were they pretty?
It's me.
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
That's all I can say.
There are some things... better left unsaid.
You wrote it.
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
No.
Show him in.
If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson.
Well, let me in.
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Black magic.
What about the dog?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
I don't.
Out the door and to the left.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
You go first.
No, man, just wait.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  Wife stays here, of course.
All damn.
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
Smokin' what?
Nothing.
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
What up, bro?
Negative...they vamped.
Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
Sorry, dude.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
He's a boy, dude.
Call me.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
Good, let's get out.
Yeah, and hurry up.
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
Business or pleasure?
Huh?
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
Oh, yeah?
My security people are right next door.
I appreciate that.
I have a problem.
That's right.
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
I would also like to apologize.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
No, that's... That's OK. We don't need any help. We'll be just fine. Won't we, Lynn?
What?
I will do no such thing.
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
You...
You fucked up.
Keep your voice down.
Forget about it.
No, that's,..that's fine
You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
No way.
I know you do, honey.
No. Kisses to you.
Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants?  They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?
What!?
What are you going to do now?
This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
Everybody does?
I kill her anyway.
Put her on.
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
Ain't nobody goin' to neither, long as Uncle Birdie's around.
Don't!
John: you go fetch Ruby.  Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
Yes! Yes!
You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
About what!
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Twenty-five wives!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
There's something else.
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
The Blue Men?
You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!
John, where are we g --
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
I don't know nothin'!
Mm-hm.
How old are you?
Can I have this?
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Our honeymoon.
I was praying.
Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
Where's your Missus?
Didn't you hear me, boy?
What are you after them for?
None of your business, Madam.
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
No, nothing.
I sure as hell hope so.
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
Get the kit!
Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
Who was scary?
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
The killer.
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
You got a sane explanation for what he did?
Dad, I want to see Rod Lane.
Nan, I --
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
Krueger.
Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room!  Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
I could hear you tossing and turning all night, kiddo. You've no business going to school.
I will.
Warm milk. Gross.
To bed with you, c'mon.
Right.
I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
The door was locked from your side.
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
He's nuts about you.
Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?
A dress you wear in the evening.
Yes.
And there?
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
You want this?
I don't want to go to Siberia.
...des raisins de Madère, des framboises... 
What do you mean they might -- they will!
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
I must be stern with you.
But, Comrades...
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
We did our best, Comrade.
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
Even the swallows are back.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
Don't hold that against me... please!
Business.
Private.
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
But you had!
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
Yes!
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
You're welcome.
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
Ni-notchka.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
You repeat yourself.
The bayonet? Did you really?
I was wounded before Warsaw.
You analyze everything out of existence. You analyze me out of existence. I won't let you. Love is not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? Why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? Why do flowers open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka, Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
I have never heard one.
I don't think so.
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!...  But he got you here.
Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
Anything, Ninotchka.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
No! No!
Yes... a kiss... salute!
Let's turn on the radio.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
Who cried that one?
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
Did you win?
Those newspaper people?
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
Am I interrupting?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
Has done what?
She's gone, Leon.
What?
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
We have nothing to discuss.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
Yes, it does.
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
I don't understand.
Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not a meadow.
It's just a place for workmen.
Where is it?
Then his office will be fine.
We could get that.
You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
I agree it's ridiculous but --
Why me?
I figured that out.
Yeah?
Jesus!  Through a window?
What the hell are you doing, Ehrlichman?  Screwing with the CIA?  I don't care how much he wants -- pay him.
My point exactly!  Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything.  Do you see me screwing everything that moves?  For Christ's sake!  I did what the New York Times editorial page said we should do!  I ended the war, I got SALT I with the Russians, I opened China!  So why are these cocksuckers turning on me?  Because they don't like the way I look.  Where I went to school.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
These State Department jerks, Bill, don't understand; you got to electrify people with bold moves.  Bold moves make history, like Teddy Roosevelt -- "T.R." -- rushing up San Juan Hill.  Small event but dramatic.  People took notice.
So?
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
What do you mean, sir?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
Yeah, but Roselli wasn't just any gangster.  He was the gangster who set up Track 2 in Cuba.
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
Sir?
Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
What about the documents he promised?
No ...
Is it my turn?
Thou must.
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
How about you?  Are you going to win?
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
I mean I got federal price controls on my oil.  The ragheads are beating the shit out of me.  And I got your EPA environment agency with its thumb so far up my ass it's scratching my ear.
The American people put me where I am.
He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
That was Mr. Kennedy.
Yes.
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
Maybe I am.
Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good.
Sir?
Yes, yes.
Not that.  Us.
If I stop ... there'll be no more talk of divorce?
Is that the truth?
You don't have to go.
Will you ... would you kiss me?
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
And what am I doing?
There'll be time for that.
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
Well, that's wonderful.  So get me this "crisis" thing, Dick; I'll be glad to take a look at it.
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
When did he die?
No ID in her room?
Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
Yessir. It may be that. In a nutshell.
You ain't heard from him?
Not word one.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Some pretty bad people.
Yes ma'am, I do.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
That's possible.
But you don't believe it.
I don't know. Oh.
Sheriff?
Yes Sheriff.
I don't know. Had dreams.
Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
I wouldn't worry about it.
...I need to sit down.
Not like that. Not like you say.
Big talk.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Yeah.
What're you goin' to do?
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
Yes I do.
You know what's goin' on?
I can't say.
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
No me mate.
Airport.
Do you know where I'm going?
Yeah? Where am I?
All right.
What way would that be?
I could come back then.
Yes I do.
I don't know. I couldn't say.
Call it?
Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails, and you have to say. Call it.
Sir?
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
Okay.
How well do you know Chigurh.
Okay. We can stop that.
You seem pretty sure of yourself. You've led something of a charmed life haven't you Mr. Wells?
You want to change rooms?
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
Yes sir.
I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
No, Elden, I need to...
You think a woman did that?!
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
What about it?
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Ad lib?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
That is a skill!
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
I'd slap his face.
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
You never know who you'll see.
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
If we're for real?
I don't follow...
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
He told us it's in the Buick.
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
I'm not telling.
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"?
...yeah.
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Because it ain't natural, young man.
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
I swear to God!
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
Sales, Mr. McGill, sales! And what do I sell? The Truth! Ever' blessed word of it, from Genesee on down to Revelations! That's right, the word of God, which let me add there is damn good money in during these days of woe and want! Folks're lookin' for answers and Big Dan Teague sells the only book that's got 'em! What do you do - you and your tongue-tied friend?
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to say that that sin's been warshed away too!  Neither God nor man's got nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, the water's fine!
What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy?
What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
Course it's Pete! Look at 'im!
Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him.  The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon.  These things-
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
That's not my ring.
Not your...
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
It was a powerful air.
He ain't our daddy!
Blooey!
You got a maiden name, Daddy?
Great.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Yeah, I know.
What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
I don't mean anything by it.
No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do.
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
I want to fly jets, sir!
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
It's important, sir!
Yes, sir!
What are you tired from?
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Vietnam?
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
Or we could do that yeah.
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
Let's just wait and see what happens.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
No. I never feel like that.
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
What's stopping you?
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
Does it still hurt?
Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.
Why'd he do it?
I don't know where that is.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
He said he grew up poor?
I've seen better.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
Please...
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
You finish.  Then we finish.
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
Raoul, what in God's name do we do if she has a gun?
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An idiot's grandson.  I'm third- generation idiot.  But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy.  You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early?  I can't believe my eyes.  Fourteen million dollars upstairs, Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole. Baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green.  Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
Huh?
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
I said open the door.
How many more do we have after this?
What?
478-0150.
Don't.
PANIC ROOM!
Little bit.  Yeah.
I am.  I'm here.
On the floor!  Get on the floor!
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
Uh uh.
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
Oh shit Alma... you're...
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
Sure, those boojie jokers don't do anything except print up a lotta paper saying "Black is Beautiful."
No more police brutality! WHAT DO WE WANT?
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
You know it. Stay Black...
Damn straight.
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
No man. PE -- "political education."
Of course. Well, I appreciate your offer, but we got things pretty well under control. Same bunch of kooks you guys already have under surveillance. They're still doing a lot of yelling and pot-smoking but nothing to worry about.
Yes sir, I did.
No sir he didn't.
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
Alone...
No you wait a second. You and your "Panthers" got three choices. One you join with us and follow our rules. Two you change your name.  Or three you face annihilation.
I don't know about that.
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
Brimmer.
You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Didn't want folks to think I was a snitch. You know?
It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
You call that a compliment?
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Very well, then.
Oh?
Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.
I will do so as soon as possible.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow.  Their posts?  We picked them up here-and-there last night.
Yes, sir.
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
And the Governor?
Yes...  ... father.
Flanking riders?
No...
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
Granted.  Where are you going?
Where?
And what do they know?
He left us.
You don't hate him.
You said bribery twice...
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
When?
Long time.
Thank you.
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.
I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men.
And what is the second thing?
Ayuh.
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!
Huh?
You believe in it.
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Not at all.
Good for you.
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
What?
But--
Yes, but--
Nothing.  Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one?
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
What did we do, Jud?
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
Well...a touch of the flu...
No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
And because the dead walked.
I will.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
We got that part.  Anything else?
Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
That so?
Did you, now?
It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Not as a condition -- a request.
Then I can wear men's clothing.
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
You're right.  Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
Yes, the rum is gone.
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
How did he get off the island?
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Somewhat.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
Agreed!
We need to go!
'Bootstrap?'
This way!
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
He may be.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Nebbleman.
Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives.  The instant, understand?
Then you still love me?
Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Cleaned up?  It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  That's what we've been trying to tell you!  The only thing we can do is run!  Run!  Run!
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
You don't want this.
I want Trix!  Mommy!
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
Mr. Sim, watch out!  O'Brien escaped and could be on his way!
Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
I guess I should be flattered.
Right.  You predicted it.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
What waste?
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
Just giving credit where credit is due.
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
No cheese.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
Like a glove.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
Where is it?
You don't have to say anything, Daniel.  I'm a scientist.  I know what's happening.  I recognize the classic symptoms.  Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
We've got to get the nanobot.
Do you suppose that was our problem? We met before our time?  I think that happens a lot.  People, events, planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place.
Oh yes you are!
You were looking for us?
The question is, are you?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I don't mind her if you don't.
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance—
Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Gallagher!
Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight.
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I—
Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play!  Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Oh, hello Mother!
Why—
You're the Tribune man?
Oh, man!
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about—
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
A what?
My play.
Araby?
Outside!
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
There you are—!
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Yes.
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
Right.
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
It'll be ready in a minute.
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
And now for that twentieth crack—
Sure.
The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
They've been ready for the last half hour.
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
Get out of here.
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Yeah.
It's haunted just the same.
I just putter.
Well sir, I'll show you.
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Yeah?
... Sex.
Looks just like it did.
Bud brought it to me.
Yes she is.
I've got to go ...
No I'm not.
Oh yeah.
With what?
It's better, Mary Sue.
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Still doesn't make it right.
Green.
What are you doing?
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote.
Neither do I.
Just take deep breaths.
I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
So what's the point?
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
Nothing.
That's great.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
It was a prop for the school play ...
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Yeah ... Sort of ...
Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ...  You know ...
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
COME BACK!!!
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
... Only if they mean it.
Why?
Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Yes.
Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
Aren't you a little early?
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do.
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
Ok. Thank you.
Hello.
I'm trying to be your friend.
I know.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
What?
It's not mine.
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
I just want to know where she's staying.
Where are you?
Really?
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
She's...not here...she went out. She went out of town, she travels a lot.
...yeah....well you have me now.
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
No.
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
You're going to work now?
Yeah.
Really? Please?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
I don't have a girlfriend --
....this is your mistake....
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
Yeah.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
Ok.
Sure.
Yeah.
....Hi.....
It's Barry.
You like her?
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
Did you pick it up from the street?
Oh that's great.
I don't know.
Really?
Ok.
I don't freak out very often.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
Ok.
Yes.
Yes I'm sorry.
If you wanted to call me back I could...
No.
I don't know.
You're hand is bleeding.
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
You want her to call you Jack?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
And I'm sorry that I did that.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
You ok?
Why you wearin' a suit?
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
You should go on a trip.
I need to talk to you for a second.
What?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
I'll see you there.
I thought Latisha said you would --
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
Put him through.
Are you coming to eat with us?
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
I'll just see you when you get back here.
He's a writer, not a madman.
For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
And my chaise -- am I being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass --
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
-- the passion in your heart --
Who's to say I did not?
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
I have.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
Most assuredly.
Is it terribly erotic?
Fiendishly so.
They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
It's only been described to me. In your books.
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
I am not a wealthy woman.
Oh, but I am!
I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
....shame on you, truly...
Forgive me, I beg you --
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
Do as I say.
Am I?
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Hope you don't mind my popping in--
Marion--
I am not that woman.
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
There's a different between want and
There is nothing to understand but this:   I am a man who could have been great, but was not.
How so?
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry.
I wanna see the picture today
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Telling stories.
But with compassion and insight--
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and Booth.  Imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian plains--
He's nothing but a hypocrite. He preaches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress.
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
Please don't say this.
Mank-
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
I'll hire you  -- right now-
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
They don't have to.
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
Mank!
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
Thank you-
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
Very generous
Please don't ask me to do this.
The ad..
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
I really think you're
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
I don't want to sit
I know what you want but it can't be done!
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
It's not done.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
You know?
Jack! Enough!
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
You want the title shot?
C'mon, Joey.
Except fall down like a normal person.
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
When?
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Well, I heard some things.
So what?
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
You guys know more about that than I do. I just fight...
Why should I be bitter? Boxing's been good to me. I got a nice house, three kids, a beautiful wife -- take a picture of her. Vickie.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
It feels real good.
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
Yeah, I sucked his cock.
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
Sure, what else is new?
Are you drunk?
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
Don't worry -- it comes off today.
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
Thanks.
I think they missed their chance with her.
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.
And how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it? Or hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime?
The police Department at Merritsville. They called to report. The trunk was just picked up -- by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
Your Lisa?
Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
She's all right.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Isn't he a salesman?
Huh?
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
Would four of them -- ?
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
Uh-huh.
Who buys them? Tax collectors?
It's just a run-of-the-mill Monday. The calendar's loaded with them.
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Three.
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
So do I.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
What are you getting at?
Thinking about Thorwald?
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
Well, -- if there was one less thread this way --  -- and two less that way --  -- I might give up bachelorhood.
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window. 
Friend of yours?
Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
Hi.
No.  We're going to bring him down.
Hold it, Jim.
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
That's funny!
Shoot, Jimbo.
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
Is there some kind of trick answer?
She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
Will you wait a minute?
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
Come with me, John.
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
I know.  That's why I came back.
I just don't want trouble.
Yeah.
It's me!
Not lately.
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
Why?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
I shot at one of them.
I can't keep it to myself anymore--
What's that got to do with it?
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
Grandma?
She eats him alive and he takes it.
Pretty mixed up?
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
You don't have to be unfriendly.
See?
Dig the square wardrobe!
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
It doesn't matter to them.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
There's just one thing.  What about--
Should we explore?
Hi.
Why?
What?
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
What's he like?
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Okay.
Hi.
I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
You said you'd call my father.
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Must have a way with stationery.
Gabriel, what are you doing!
What are you doing here?!
-- till he fucked his parole --
Saw me --
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
What the fuck is going on.
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
You're in on this.
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
Nick, the ice is --
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
Part of... with them?
They all are. Football's on.
Keep 'em there for a little while.
Well. I'm going home.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
You what...
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
What's her greatest fear?
The hell you don't.
You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is.  We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
More than you know.
Sing it in pictures, Nick.
No.
You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
Take 'em.
He's not Nick Mason...
Mr. Bangs.
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
It's a roach, guy --
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
What, working security?
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Now where were we?
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
Yes.
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?" Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit. I mean a real animal. And apparently he would so things to her.
Me and Mr. White?
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
What?
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again.
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin."
Cause you're a faggot, alright?
Dead as Dillinger.
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
No, they're not.
Like hell I am.
Shut up!  Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, I paid for your goddamn breakfast.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Why?
It's a surprise.
Nice Guy Eddie.
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
No, I'm not!
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin' ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
Nope.
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
So what is it?
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Well, he knows a little about me.
Of course.
That fuckin did it!
So you wanna git bit, huh?
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
Maybe he did.
Why didn't you say so. Go right out and get her. Ed. build the fire up.
No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
Where do you keep the can opener?
No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
Why?
I don't want to run short.
In a fight?
And meet him there.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have, but I know a sight more about people and I wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
Three men on matched roans?
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
All right, you didn't know.
Stop it -- stop it.
Well, say it.
Even women?
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Depends on how good you drive.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
And we're running out of that.
We don't want to go there.
Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
Maybe I could start you out.
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
You were supposed to be reading words.
Never happened!
No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues...
Okay.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Hugh Kane.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
I was thinking the same thing.
No. Try a little higher.
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
But he'll kill her!
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Yes!!!!
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Almost... Look, I gotta bounce. I'll holla at you later.
Hey, I got an idea.
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Are you?
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
That's right.
How is she?
My holy water.
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
Can we watch that scene again? You know, where he rips out her heart?  PLEEEASE?
I'm so happy I could shit.
Your mom killed my brother!
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
We have to concentrate on life, Eugene.
You're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! Shhhh! The kids!
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
FUCK YOU! 
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
COCKSUCKER! 
I didn't do it!
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
Marvin A. Pickles.
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
...Browsing.
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
What's he know?
Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! 
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
It's the last door at the end of this hall.
Listen ——
Yes, I understand.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
What circumstances?
How's Miss Jacqueline?
You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
That you love Mary.
Why wait?
I won't get lonely.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
Yes.
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
Good. We all understand each other. You, Gregory and I. We all know. There is sunlight in the streets and work to do. Both of you -— you're off to work.
Well, since, you're over twenty one——
What a peculiar question.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
It might have.
Yes, Miss Gibson. I've come to take you to your sister.
It seems right to us.
No. She's no longer under my care.
I'll be out in a minute.
She's not been here for a long time.
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
Have you any other relatives, Mary?
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
We haven't even begun tea yet.
It won't hurt.
Oh.
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
No, I think you look... fine.
You mean like "time flies"?
Hmm. Well, maybe you are. Really, I wouldn't pay much attention.
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
Basically, yes.
I can see that. What are they?
Who's Donna?
Why not?
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
What will you do when the money runs out?
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
I guess not.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
What was the problem?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
Subtlety?
I'm not planning on it.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
No.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
I know.
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Yeah, I know.
So it was recently that you tried this.
No, I haven't.
Not really.
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
Because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and I just hate her she's such a little slut I thought that in high school and I think that now. Why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? I mean, it's okay and everything, but I don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that?
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
He doesn't have a phone.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
Fine.
Well, why?
No, it's nothing like that.
Because I wanted to.
You are in trouble.
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
I feel like I do.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
I don't want to discuss it.
Then why do you keep asking about it?
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
I just want to know why you're here.
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
And you ask questions, right?
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Yes.
No? Not even one more?
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
You're intrigued?
Cynthia. John.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
I like the way he dresses.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
It won't. I trust him.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
You were prying before?
What do you mean?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
What tapes?
Hi. Want a drink?
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects?
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
Rollo! How'sa boy? I was just thinking about you.
Lemme clarify for you.
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
Yeah? What do I do then?
NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
Of course.
Fools!
What's cookin', Bert?
Congratulations!  It's 'Happy Homes' for Harry and Emily Weiss of Denton.
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
Why Janet?
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
He was a President.
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
I don't want to get up there.
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
I know.
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
Surely.
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Bye.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Great. You look great.  You both do.
Me too.
That's on us.
It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
It's not even a mile.
We should have driven.
It does. Feels right.
You know that chick?
Perfect.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Shut up.
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
Yeah. Okay.
Okay! Jesus!
Nope.
Huh.
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
With Maya.
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
What exactly are we going to do?
I said okay?
I know what you need.
Are they too sporty?
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
That's thoughtful.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
That was quite a day yesterday.
You need a new car anyway.
Good for you.
The Windmill.
Oh yeah? How is it?
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
"The Day After Yesterday."
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
A paper?
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
I guess.
Both.
This one?
I heard them Morgan.
Who said I was going to die?
I don't feel much.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
I'm not going to curse.
Yes.
How can you say that?
Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something.
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
What are you doing?
Me too.
They tell you everything in this book.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
Sounds like a virus.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I think we ought to get out of here.
That's why they got you in jail?
All right then.  Let's go.
Wait a minute. Get down off of there, Augie.
McKendrick's men got him.
She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
I guess I put a good scare into him.
Yeah... that must have been it.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
I already did that.
That I do.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
I expect.
What happened?
Why, J.T., watch what you're saying around Augie. Emmett didn't kill anybody.
I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
Howdy.
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
You're kidding.
I was afraid of that.
Daddy's dead.
I don't have any family any more.
Why would they stop you?
It's been a while.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
I run the place. What can I get you?
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
You like a good saloon?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
Okay -- for you.
We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
Almost right.
I can't wait to meet her.
"Forever".
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
You're so good to protect her like this.
She said you were very beautiful.
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
Not quite.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
Impossible.
I want you back too, Viktor.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
So you did meet her?
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
There's... a wall between you --
Not like this --
-- Flesh is weak.
I'm already dead.
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
I do okay.  How about you?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
I know.  Thank her for me.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy.  We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
This is the story.
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
You know what I'm talking about.
Don't step in the horse manure.
Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?
Dr. Crowe.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
What about Mrs. Marschal?
Yes.
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
Them?
I don't know.
Oh.
They want me to do things for them.
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
...Chicken blood? Who said it was... "chicken blood"?
Oh yeah? Why's that?
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next.
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
Manure... is life.
Old Macdonald had some... MOONSHINE!
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
Sure. What do you want to know.
Amends...?
I --
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
Down boy.
He started it.
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
Chicken sandwich?
Nothing to tell.
Whatcha' doin'?
Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
Oh, yeah?
It's my nature.
That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Shelby --
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Sorry.
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
It's just a work thing.
My present?
Okay.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
You paying for the gas?
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
Is this fun?
They're both a challenge.
Seriously?!?
Would I lie to you?
Ciao.
I would've come back for you.
Yeah.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
You take the front, I'll take the back.
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
The minute you see him, you'll know.
I'll do it.
Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
No.
Go.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Why are we doing this?
Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
Not for long, you ain't.
Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy. 
'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
I ran into complications.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
We're outta motion lotion.
I'm cucumber cool.
Yeah, but...
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Pick it up, Breaker.
About one to five years worth.
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
Where the hell are you?
What's he...
Yes, sir.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
You woulda?
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
I left him a message.
I know you left him a message. What did you say!
They what? What? No. No. Why?
Difficult to explain everything now...  And much larger issues loom.  I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.
And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot, the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was to neutralize Israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart. Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel's personal physician, who was also on the Sparazza payroll.
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
Yeah... Sid?
So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy, some Swede, real badass, supposedly a "specialist" and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap -- so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this in the next day or so, get to Israel before the Swede can, we got chits, y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him, ransom him back, pick up that nut, we're that much closer to having our own thing.
Yeah, I can front this.
Cold blood Sid, dead eyes, y'know?
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
I'm working on it.
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
What were you doin' here anyway?
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
What's the time frame?
Leave the light off.
Can it work?
You'll end up like me.
I want to hear your version.
Her?  Who are you talking about?
Yes.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
He's dead.
He'll let me in.
Why, who did you see?
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
You do, you don't.  She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it.  Don't you see?  No, you don't.
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
Jesus...
What do you mean?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
It's something.
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
You don't love me.
Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
I want you here.
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
I can't --
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
You must have been dreaming.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Beg pardon?
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
Let's get a drink.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
Stop being nuts!
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
Do you dance?
Yeah.  It's all over.
And I'm making mine.
Take my advice, don't buy any...
Get in bed.
You don't want to hear about it.
I think -- she's crazy.
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
She bought it.
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
I'll be right up.
I watched TV.
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
You should'a brought the girl.
Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in.
Okay, I guess.
Shooting.
Be nice.
No. No, that's okay.
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn't.
Cause if you get in a bind--
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
Flash, drop it--
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
Yeah--
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
I don't think he wants me to find him.
Some things you should say anyway.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
I hate people with alliterative names.
Thank God.
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
Hurry up, Flash!
You'd feel what?
Strong...
Nah.
I know him.
Peter-- my condolences.
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
It'll shut itself off.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
No!
Really, Professor, I--
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
Just drop me off here.
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Roger.
You stink, Sefton!
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Why not?
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
What some brandy?
It's on me.
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
You will remember the name? Von Scherbach? VON SCHER-BACH!
What exactly is he charged with?
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
She'll never forgive me!
You're crying, Animal.
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
Why, sure!
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
You starting that again?
What's the decoy?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Thirty-fifth.
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
That is my wife.
Full disruptors.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
All hands, brace for impact!
What happened to you?
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
Can I?
Please, please.
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Yes.  Thank you.
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
Thank you.
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
What is it?
David... Sorry I'm late.
I went wrong.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Underground deposit?
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
Short range scan.
David --
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
Sir...?
Goodbye, David.
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
Yes, Admiral. Step into my parlor.
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
Torpedoes coming in -- !
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
... Yes...
Yes... But -- how...?
But sir! Federation Starship approaching.
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
I'm not a drama critic.
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
Uh -- what are they?
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
Ah.
I can spare me...
Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
Is that a poem?
Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
Mother, go back!
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
What's the matter -- ?
What do you want with us? I demand --
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
That makes two of us.  Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death --
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
Raise the shields...
First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
Admiral --
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
Home.
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
It would explain a great many things --
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Aye sir --
Be careful, Jim...
She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four.
Or the one.
In my quarters, Uhura.
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
You may ask, Lieutenant.
Energize defense fields.
The <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>, sir.
At what.
Aye, sir.
Dismiss the company.
You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.
Visual.
Try again.
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
By the book...
Spock... The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings. But as my son, you have them. They will surface.
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
I just wish we could cloak the stench.
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
... My shoes...
Then how.?
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
It is.
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
Can you isolate the wave?
... It gives me a great sense of history.
Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
I was not.
You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
Why's that?
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
Implicitly.
You're upset about losing the whales.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
I'm all ears.
You want the details?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Here... In the park?
... Damn!
Calm yourself, Nurse.  Scotty, get us out of here!
You need me.
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
How do you know this...?
Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
For example?
Ah... The giants.
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
Our <u>mission</u>! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about <u>that</u>!!
Right.  Will you help us?
<u>You?</u>  Spock, that's extraordinary.
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.
Aye. But I've never beamed up 400 tons before.
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
No power to the bay doors.
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Sulu Hikaru.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
There are days.
By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
What's the rush?
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
For what purpose?
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
Bye.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
I don't know.
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
Good luck. Dougherty out.
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
Scan for lifesigns.
I'm sure. Just don't forget what they did to us.  We'll have them rounded up in a day or two... we needn't bother with the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.
Deck ten.
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
We're not going anywhere.
Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
Would you like something to eat?
It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
Picard to Crusher...
Good question.
If that's true, they're a dying race.
... I'm not sleeping well...
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
That'll be interesting.
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
That might not be so bad... at least for you.
At least four hours.
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
I do not know what you are referring to.
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
There should be an access hatch nearby...
We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
Entering the upper ionospere...
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
Well, with any luck... the Vulcans will land outside Resurrection tomorrow morning... and Earth will never be the same again.
Active.
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Thank God this plate was already fixed.
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
On screen.
Onscreen.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
Agreed. Options?
The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation.
Wil... Data was down there.
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -
Spock's looking for us...
Come on...
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
They'll make it look like an accident...
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
Very much.
WHAT HAPPENED?
There... were no other ships in the sector.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Your honors, the State rests.
Uhura, monitor!
Then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
Now we go to Starfleet?
She programmed the torpedo hits?
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Not me, idiot - HIM!
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
Anything else you want to tell me?
Possibly.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
When does this conference start?
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
LET THEM DIE.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
Azetbur has agreed to meet the Federation at a undisclosed location to continue her father's work... the conspirators obviously intend to try again...
Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
This is Enterprise. We surrender. Repeat  Enterprise surrenders --
I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant.
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
Not as yet, sir.
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
No.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
No. Can I move now?
For how long?
Yes.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
To happy endings.
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
Aye, sir... This way.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
Fire!
Of you?
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
Divert power and compensate.
Do you have a name, sir?
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
Emergency force fields are holding.
The resemblance is... striking.
Make it so.
Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips, my loins?
Thank you, Commander.
Theories?
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
We’ve got him!
Aye, sir.
Deanna, on my mark.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
If you don't mind.
She's the most beautiful ship I’ve ever seen.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
No?
Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Yes.
I have no reason to.
Were we always explorers?
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
You're not Reman.
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
It is... invigorating.
Do as I tell you!
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
Seven minutes.
None.
Now go. I have some personal business.
For the moment.
Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...
Have a nice trip.
Eh... yes.
Make any money?
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.
Oh shit!!!
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
Which way do you want to go?
Ah no.
What.
Gear shift.
I am Jenny Haydn.
Closed.
I am husband?
Candy.
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
Shit!
My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
No.
Then let me go. You don't need me.
A baby is a new person?
Do you have a baby?
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
Yes.
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Please stay.
What?
The captain...
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
Horses.
You don't forget anything, do you?
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
Many, many days and nights...
I must go.
My grandmother's rich.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
No, Lenny.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
You talked to Iris?  When?
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
It's you up on that stage, not him. You don't need him.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
W'sup, Max?
Looks like she was holding out.
Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff about a death squad.  A group a guys loyal to the hardline school.  Guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks, suspending cops right and left, tying their hands... while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us, save us, do something you fucking morons, crime is totally out of control.
That's pretty much the way it happened.
Naawww.
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
Commissioner Strickland.
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Okay, you got my attention, but this is cutting off the circulation to my head, here.  D'you mind?
She's my destiny.
You'll see.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
You sure?
Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
Yeah I know.  So what do we do?
I've got a good idea, yeah.
Well, look at the plus side.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
You never told me.
Then we'll be right where we are now.
Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
See you downtown.
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
This isn't in our database?
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Hi there.
You heard?
You must travel a lot, huh?
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Look...
Not bad, huh?
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
What kind?
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Speck. Harold Speck.
Do you think he singled you out?
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
Okay, Harold Speck: who goes first?
It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
There was talk of a file photo.
As far as the public knows, Richard Low is dead. And he will stay dead until we kill him.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
Five months. I love it.
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
"Gone live?"
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
And one other thing.
What's this country coming to?
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
I've been thinking about this.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
You mean --
That's true.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
I just need to go a little slow.
Jaime? Where are you?
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
I...
Kulok.
The little piggie speaks.
"Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession..."
I already have an employer.
Those were just fantasies.
The boy's okay. I saw him...
I want to help you.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
What did you do to end up here?
Thomas Mackelway.
Sounds like fun.
Koessler?
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
Murman!
Shit.
You have to put things in perspective.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
What do you drive?
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
You better pay the man.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Like the quiche?
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
What what? What advantages?
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking...
What an asshole.
No matter what... like splitting aces.
...And she's with someone else.
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
...well, it suits you...
Lorraine?
Yeah, hold on.
No, no. Hold on.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
You don't call.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
I do. Good for you, man.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
There's the rub.
Him?
I'm such an asshole.
I didn't make it...
Sure.
I can't believe you.
You asshole.
Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
What are they doing here?
We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Wow, I guess you were home... 
S'up Trent?
I don't know...
They're all skanks.
What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
You gotta give Tee one thing. He's good with the ladies.
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
Selling scrap metal.
It starts at eight...
...through the kitchen...
You looked right at her, baby.
What a surprise.
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
...you're money...
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
Our little baby's growing up...
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
I ask for Justice.
Shut up.
Yeah.
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
OK, but be careful.
The guy at the gate's outside...says there's a package...
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
Tom said he'd take care of it.
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
Accept what's happened, Michael.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
How?
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
Where are you going?
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
Come Sunday morning:  My name is Vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.
You look good, too.
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
We're all tired...
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
I'm German-Irish.
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
No.
Huh?
Let me think about it, O.K.?
We don't have to disconnect them, we can wheel the stand with the bed.
How can you be sure?
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
Forgive me, Godfather, let our years of friendship be my excuse. How can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up?  The two  go hand in hand. And with you gone from here the Barzini and the Tattaglias will be too strong for us.
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
Is he alive?
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
Bird!
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
I didn't mean with you in it.
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
How?
You love me and you're not marrying me.
What evening?
Marge-maintenance.
Who is it?
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...
Far cry from New York.
No, he should talk to you alone.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car. The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman.
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
Bird. That's jazz.
It's superb.
So I'm learning.
He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times...
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
What does that mean?
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
Dickie?
And you, sir? Any better?
I don't believe a single word you've said.
Oh Marge.
No glasses.
I think we sort of found each other.
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
A hotel would've been fine.  We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
Excuse me?
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
Beating you away.
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
You know what -- I am.
They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
Thanks.
That's good, isn't it?
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
I'll fix some drinks.
Or I could come back.
You try. You try talking to her.
What do you want to change about this moment?
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiancée.
What about Thomas Ripley?
You have, yes.
That's the Colt .25 -- a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
That's really something.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
It keeps ya busy.
Oh. Who was that again?
He'll, what else can I do with it all?
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
With who?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
No.
For a fee.
Stick up?
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
Where.
You carry a piece? You need one?
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
He looks like a killer.
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
You're not much with girls, are you?
Yes I am.
Twenty-six.
You moonlightin?
So I hear.
Take it or leave it.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
What's going on?
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Well, I just, you know...
It happens.
Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am.
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
Well yes I suppose ...
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back.
Hi.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
That always used to work.
I did?  Huh!
Well... where can we go?
You must not remember anything. Come on.
How'd they get it inside?
Whoa.
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Go ahead, son.
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
Thanks.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Didn't you have any help?
... Ernie.
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Anybody take it?
I wanna close up soon.  C'mon, let's call her.
I guess I did.
It's okay, son.  We just need to call you something.  That's all.
Thanks.  Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are...
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
Why not?
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
What do you mean?
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
Some of it might come back to you.
Thanks.
That you got let go.
No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
Yes, I did.
How do you like our little hamlet?
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
When was this?
A trifle.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
I see.
You get straight to the point, don't you?
And the second?
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
Cathy!
Oh, I suppose so.
Don't you like us?
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
Why are they trying to kill people?
Morning.
Yep.
Where does he live?
Right across the bay there.
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Mmmm.
Yep?
The little Brenner girl?
Yes.
Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
What happened?
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
A what?
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
Shhh. Shhh.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
Cathy. At the school.
Do I sound foolish to you?
I couldn't ask you to.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
I didn't break that window!
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
It deliberately came down at you -- you're bleeding...
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
You like me, huh?
I'm sure.
He was watching a ball game on television.
Oh, yes.
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
Yes.
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
Why?
It is for me.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
What'll it say?
No, I have my things in the car.
Of birds?
Certainly, of birds.
So they united.
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
What do you mean?
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
It may not be last week again for a long long time.
Have we still got power?
Maybe.
Wait here. Don't move.
I have no idea.
Yes, certainly. 
Do you have any lovebirds?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
For what purpose?
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
Good.
Good morning.
I'm only a student.
It's not the failure. I feel that MacFarlane has taught me nothing. He taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
MacFarlane
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
I remember her.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
Yes, I suppose so.
Believe it or not.  It's best for you to pretend that you do.  After all, it was you who ordered this specimen, received it here, and paid for it.  That makes you a party to murder.
Confound me, the child's a cripple, of course she wants to walk.  Child, I say to you get up out of that chair and walk.
But you'll have to stand great pain, Georgina.  Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness.  Do you want it that much?
I can't.
Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name.  Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too.  But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
The same. Look here, Gray --
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
The heart pumps it.
This is a gift.
Get out of here!
Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
A pleasure to torment me?
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
How long ago?
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
She would if she could.
Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.
You can get out.
I'm looking for my friends.
Tell her... we'll get him.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
I don't know you, man.
Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis.  Exhibit A.
Who are you?
The scar.
Nobody.
No. You don't.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
Erin knows, doesn't she?
Not tonight. Honest.
He said he'd prove it.
No.
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
What do you mean, dear?
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Where is that?
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Why not, Bobby?
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
Thank you... Have you any news?
I can judge only by what I see.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
But how -- how long--?
How long will I live?  That no one can say.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
You better get some fresh air.
Can't stand light?
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
We are awesome monster-bashers!
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
For a ride.
Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
What?
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
Good!
Did we have a date tonight?
Grandpa has plans of his own.  Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you.  You come home late.  You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change.
Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
I'm tired now.
Not that poor.
We can't talk about it on the phone.
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
No, I'm not...
I hear this is the decade for cute.
He doesn't walk all over me.
Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
Well, I...
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
Let's go see them.
Why not?
So do I!
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
What about Mom?
Maybe.
You promise?
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
Probably the next meal.
He's gone already!  Do it!
For your health.
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Then we'll never make it.
Come on, Copper.
I guess I'm the only one.
Damn you, MacReady!
Nothing we can do about that.
In this weather?
When was the last time you used it?
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
That far?
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
No.
I'll put this right through your head.
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
Anyplace but here.
The generator!
Position, my ass...
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
What?!
Can't hear you.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
I'm so sorry, Kalen.
What else can they do?
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
Where?
How did you know?!
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
1899.
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
Can you show us where they live?
Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.
What?
Yes.
Oh, shut up.
This is the way in?
Do you know which way?
End...?
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
After all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that?
Because...
I -- what are you?!
What's happening to the moon?!
I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --
Got here as soon as I could.
Dance with me...
Darling.
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
Where's the challenge in that?
She's gotten into your equations.
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
I would.
In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
More than 800,000 years.
For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by, I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
Learning was important?
Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...
Is it?
If you only knew...
It's undamaged?
Please, I beg you.  Take him away from here --
Here?
No, sir --
Sir --
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
You know that's not true.
You'll tell me more tomorrow?
They're inside --
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
[Pointedly] Of course you're not.
My business?
You sure you know where to find one?
Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
Oh yeah, what'd he say?
I never touched your father! I swear!
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago.
[Beat] What's your name?
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
I don't know.
They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
Ok, I guess.
I guess I'd ask you why.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
You thought my father was crazy?
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
How...how do you know?
Who told you this?
The Jacket.
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
I don't think so.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Do you have a motel or something? Money?
Thanks.
[Beat] Why?
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
Who do you think did it?
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
That's lonely for you, I guess.  I always think of motel rooms as lonely.
J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
What?
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
How?
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
A regular outlaw.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Wire it to the Western Union in Oklahoma City,
No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office.  I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road.  And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you.  I'll have to tell you the code.
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
Can we get another room?  Just put it on my credit card.
It's me.
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Front.
What time are you gonna pick me up?
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Isn't this fun?
Yeah!
Ready when you are.
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Nothing.  It got messed up.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
You think you've found your calling?
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Yes!  I believe I am!
I want you to call Darryl.
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
Why not?!
Just past Boise City.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
Harlan.
What?!  What about him?!
Yes.
You do?
Are you alright?
Whatever.
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
We can change our names.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
What?!  What d'you think?!
Oh.
What in the hell is that up there?
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
Fuck you.
Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it.  The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony...
You sent that?
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
Yeah, right.
You're kidding? What did they say?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!
Mints?
Hm?
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Jesus Christ you're right.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
'That right?
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
A girl after your own heart, Ted.
Same here again.
I beg your pardon?
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
I guess.
Warren!
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
Well, I know you're busy...
Nope. Never been.
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Harvard?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Hm?
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
No I'm not.
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh.
No time, Magda, my show's starting.
Good lookin'?
What's a mook?
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
Where would I have seen your work?
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
Oh, are you on the team?
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.
Hi, Ted.
You look great.
No short game.
Toy poodle!
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
That you put a murderer on my trail?
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on.
We can't do that, Bobby.
-- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Just wanted to see for myself.  They're burning their documents.
Cuba.
Yeah.
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
Still heading for Cuba.
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
Mr. President, there is another possibility we haven't considered. This may not be a coup at all.
A thing like this... who could even think of winning?
I said his heart, not his attention.
Yeah.
No way.
Damn right I'm scared.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Just a second, Mr. President.
Don't get too attached.
You're my hero, Carl.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
James Looks Twice?
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
Good.
I got one up on ya.
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. The Warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.
-- I know. I fed it, and I can't get rid of --
And get rid of the dog.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
And...
The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
Crow Horse, listen --
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
Stop.
He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
We're in there. We're in there --
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
Come back?
Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
I could be, too.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
And I asked someone. CHARLIE You think you're pretty smart.
For what?
I'm special.
Lieutenant...
What if he's not?
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
What about the plane?
You're an animal.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
Why, what's gonna happen?
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
It does.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
Now?
Off me or off you?
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
How could you?
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
What is?
Saving them some paperwork.
So, you're scared--so what? You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
BREAKING LEFT!
Yawing right.
I can recover. Hold on!
Just relax.
The plane is fine.
But I have to!
What do you want?
Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
Tom Kazansky.
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
Look, Ma, top of the world!
Just once, if they take your plane away.
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
I didn't do it, he did it himself. Something about a wife and kid. The fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. I know it. You were up there, you know it, too. GOOSE Give him a break, Skipper. It was raining snakes up there. He'll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home...
He won again.
GOT 'EM.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.
Bad?
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
Me?
All right.
You may not think so, but you are.
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
And you get a kickback.
Hey, I got four kids to feed.
You're nothing!  You're nobody!  You're a stupid dream.  Well all dreams come to an end.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
Any news of Quaid?
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Poor baby.  This is getting to be an obsession.
Lori, I don't believe it...You're jealous of a dream!
Lori, move.
There's lots nicer places than Mars.
Bye.
--I got a trip to Mars.
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
Implanted.
I'm honored.
How real does it seem?
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
Blondes.
Not any more.
Why would I lie to you?
You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
I saw them.
People are dying, Quaid!!  Stop!!  We've got to get air!!
Then kiss me quick...before you wake up.
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
No problem.
Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
My cannon.
Burt, can you hear me now?
Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
Nope, there!  That's one.
You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
Well, yeah!  There's going to be major research up here.  First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do?  Camp out down below and just wait for him to die?
Oh shit!
So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons.  No way they could stop it.
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
I didn't do it!  What's going on?
Around here?  Why would they?
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
Please... I need to sleep...
And one good guy.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
-- With objection!
I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
Let's snuff this lowlife!
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
Oh really?
A "description"? What, Asian male 18 to 30, black hair, brown eyes?
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
I specialize, Roger...
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
I don't know but it makes one hell of an opening statement.
...Are you sure we want that?
-- Yeah?
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
-- Eddie...
I'm not that desperate.
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
I've seen this picture before.
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
I don't need sleep!
Exactly what happened then?
...Okay...
Well I know that you're innocent, Shu -- even if you forgot.
See-cil. I'm Eddie Dowd, this is Roger Baron. We're lawyers.
Y-yes, sir.
No, s-sir.
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
No, Mr. Dowd, you'll see me in court. I'm prosecuting this case.
Objection.
-- in a context.
-- Eddie told you?
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
Albert.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
Out back in our morgue.
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK.
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
That would indicate that it's the future.
No.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
Shorthand. Really?
What do you mean?
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
I see. He does talk loud.
I don't know, Sam.
Oh.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
It's late, Sam.
I think that's a good idea.
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
I don't know what to do.
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
Oh god, Laura.
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
No, you're the muffin.
Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
I'm not.
Send me a kiss.
And what a muffin you have.
What about tonight?
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
You know it and I know it.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
No.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Bobby didn't give you this?
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
I don't know.
What did you say?
Norma, are you alright?
Ah. How did they treat you?
The man's an ambulance chaser...
No -- we don't want this case in court.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
You thought it was just.
Gruber...
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
That's not my handwriting.
I thought I would need it.
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
...of Anesthesiology?
I'm on the staff of...
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
Yes!
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
...I made a reservation at...
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I am on the staff of...
Yes.
...and you're going to do that?
...that's perfectly all right.
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
Mrs...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Yes.
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
Listen to me, fella...
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Still looking.
Why?
Really. How wonderful for you.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Maybe I can do something right.
Is this a bad time.
Yes.
If I don't 'grow up...'
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
It's over!
What is that to you...?
No... no...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
How come you're calling me from...?
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big...
Nothing happened.
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
...I know. I went...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
I'm going to see you get that chance.
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
...hey, I don't need your charity...
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
Right.
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Today is Tuesday. What?
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Yes.
...of the procedures...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
The Big Boy did...?
Huh.
Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake. As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.  P.S. He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years.  You like that story?
That won't start no more fires.  We might's well go home.
Come on out!  We're friends!
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
There's nobody left around here now.
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
Like...ah...
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
No.  The air's going to be full of Jets in a minute...And there they are!
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
Don't let's lose each other.
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
How would I know...!
And I...I've got other things happening.
Yes, but...
I don't follow.
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
No...
Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him.  Did he say anything while he was still lucid?
These look quite fresh.
They are...it happened in tonight's quake.  It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
I like this story.
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Here.
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
You didn't jump in.
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
You really think Dylan's okay?
Yeah, sure.
You know damn well it's more than that now!  How can we stop him?
Robert?  I...
We were idealists.
Give me some time to blow the man down...
Weight!  Hey!  Blow the man down...
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Well, that's all part of it.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Thank you.
You came back, Tod.  You came back.
Whatever.
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
To take a piss.
Wanna bet?  Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about.  You know why it takes me so long to write papers?  because I can't spell.  While everybody else is sleeping, I'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.
Believe what?
Her name.  Bregitta.  It's poetry.
Yeah.  How'd you do.
This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  When you stand up and are counted.
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
I thought this was your dream come true.
That's not why he's sending me.
I know enough.
Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
No, I didn't.
Passport?
'Cause they're getting a divorce.  That's why they sent me here.  My sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
My dad.
Swear to God.  Only good advice he ever gave me.  Now, go back to sleep.
Unfurl the squares!
I don't know.
Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
That's enough.
What?  Come on...
I figured it out.
Each one of you will be responsible for one student.  I'll expect you to be courteous.  You represent this school and your country.  We'll sail in the morning.
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
Thank you. It's listeners such as yourself who made me want to get up out of that hospital bed and back into the studio as fast as I could.
Yessir.
I don't mean your head head - I'm not gonna piss on your head - your hair an' all... Just piss in the toilet. Y'all take a listen - here a deep sound comin' down from Bobby Peru.
No.
You an indian?
No.
Come on outside, I got somethin' to show ya.
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
You heard from Reggie?
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
What happened on the charges?
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
What?
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Why, honey?
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
Hell, peanut...
One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin' sandwiches in the kitchen.
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
They sure do stink.
Got anyplace special in mind?
What's that, honey?
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
What was this one?
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
Told you not to call your mama.
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
It's a comfortin' idea.
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
So where'd you say you was?
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
Take care of him?
Where?
Yes.
No... But...
Santos... I can't...
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
You're welcome.
She left me. Crabs.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Just go around him.
Tripp, where the hell...
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
Only in your bones?
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
...we find the jacket.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
That was MacCaulay.
That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
Bullshit. It's mine, motherfucker.
Is that in my chart?
Her dog, yes.
Better luck next time.
No, really...
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
It's colder in there.
That's really it.
Really?
You?
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single- spaced?
But... ?
Washed up?
So where have you been staying?
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
What kind of dancer?
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Kinship. And what's here?
How can you tell?
It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's --  Who said anything about girlfriend?
Not you. Your talent.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
No thanks.
Near Carvel?
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up.
I'm a little worried, James.
I think so... What about you?
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
I thank you.
Oh. Well. I...
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
That good, huh?
I got the message you called too.
She's left the room before. She always came back.
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
You got me.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
James Leer.
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
I know.
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
Oh?
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
I don't know. It might be...
Maybe I should read it.
I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
Why did you come here, Grady?
Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
I might have his number on campus.
Just a few then. The big ones.
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
Annette? She's good... tense.
This little table is one heavy bitch.
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
The birthday party.
Annette will see you.
Early July.
Isn't it?
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
Birds.
Robin.
No.
You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though.
I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill.
'Fraid not.
It gives me headaches.
I will be in three months.  I can't wait. I hate being eleven. It has to be the stupidest age in the world.
Robin?
Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.
Will I see you again?
The job's okay.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
I wish you'd give it a try.
I don't feel anything.
That is a marvelous image, Walter. Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around.
How do you define it?
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
They usually tell me.
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
Is this the first one?
I want you to calm down.
I want to talk about it now.
Sorry.
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
Not so fast.
Where?
I don't like nobody behind my back!
What else?
You felt pleasure.
I was six years old!
I meant later... when you two took naps.
How do you feel about that?
Guess I'm not like most women.
Neither do you.
They're all assholes.
I thought you were a dyke.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
I like the noise.
You're damaged.
It's been a while since...
How about in the morning.
I suffer from insomnia.
Get your kicks somewhere else.
Sounds like a special guy.
They seduce you?
What odds?
Neither am I.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
Who doesn't?
Do you want to talk about it?
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
Wasn't up to me.
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
No.
Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
No.
Not in this thing.
You noticed.
How?
I don't know how!
God, I hate that bitch.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
What's the timer set for?
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
Ask him a pressure effects.  Tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
A little more so this time.
No, Dad, it isn't.
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
At what?
At the ruins. They're very ancient, you know.
Who knows why they all left...
What! Get married?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
I was only joking, really... Can't I make a joke? And now you've got to tell me why you don't want to.
I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
Tell me once more.
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
You say that just to flatter me.
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
What is it?
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
I ... I ... wasn't feeling well ... I.. I was sleeping... I don't know anything ... I ... I'm all mixed up and ...
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
But where did you come from?
I'll go and get my valise.
Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
No.
Through someone else?
Who?
She'd punish me.
Why?
Who tells you these things?
No.
It's not that... it's not that...
No I don't.
Yes.
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Yes.
Where?
And what happened?
I fell asleep.
Is that where they say it came from... ?
Agnes, how are babies born?
Would you like to ask them?
What do you mean?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Anything?
Would you like some?
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
No... do you?
You have trouble sleeping?
Because I don't want one.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
No...
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
I'm afraid.
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
Did you want it to come out?
Hm hmm.
Do you know who put it there?
Yes.
Why?
She'd seen him too.
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
Yes.
For what he made me go through.
Who?
It was alive wasn't it?
Sister...
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I'll have a decision by next week.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
How do you survive?
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
How did she hide it during the day?
I haven't a clue.
What man had access to her?
None as far as I know.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
That's ridiculous...
No... not in the eyes of the police.
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
I am...
Visitors to the convent.
Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Stupid woman... and that's all?
I'd love one.
All right?
Long, thin and filtered.
Hand rolled.
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Become?  One is born a saint.
Would it stop you if I did?
You're what?
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
She is an innocent.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
That's what I have to believe...
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Is it because she's a nun?
For what?  An abortion?
You wanted that child out of the way.
And the baby.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
Wasn't it!
Your cards... lay them down... face up.
Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
Just you?
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Read 'em!
I'll murder that Lennon.
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
Of course I can.
But I won't.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
A butcher?
Now what's that supposed to mean?
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
I'll look in here again.
The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
I'm not ...
The big hammer?
They ought to be.
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Have you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
What are they saying?
Is there a fire, then?
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
Yeah ... so what?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
Hiding.
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Practising to be thick-headed, you're there already.
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
You two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.
You've lost him.
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
A proper Aborigine.
Kill drive engines.
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
Just short of Zeta II Reticuli.  We haven't even reached the outer rim yet.
Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.
Drop begins... now!  Fifteen kilometers and dropping... twelve... ten... eight and slowing.  Five. Three.  Two.  One kilometer and slowing.  Lock tractor beams.
Receiving.
Take a look.
What is it, I can't --
You want to try?
Take care.
Don't you remember?
I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
A voice transmission.
What?  <u>Why</u>?
How's it coming on the engines?
Not <u>they</u>... <u>he</u>...
Dead!
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
What?
And be right back.
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
Maybe we can catch it.
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
No... the risk is too great.  Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
Is it armed?
Thanks for the thought. 
How far?
The commander normally has first publication rights.
Well, it's finally happened.
Engine room, what happened?
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Good!  Moisture content?
Any microorganisms?
Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
Found what?
What killed it?
Martin, this is an order!  Open the door!
He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
We're coming!
Go ahead, Jay.
Let's be democratic.
By eating our food supplies.
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Yeah... I forgot.
It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Yeah...
Yeah.  Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.
It's on the board.
What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
Quick!  Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop maintenance pit.
No, but I got something that might interest you.
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
Next time you have a thought like that? Keep it to yourself.
That's a fact.
What?
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
What's wrong?
I'm picking up another signal.
Okay.
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.
Agreed.
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
It needn't be.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
Yes. The Shubert.
Eddie...
I believe I will.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
D-day.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
You know me better than that.
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
Yes, you did. You still do.
What of it?
Take your nap, now. And good luck for tonight.
You're being childish.
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
I do not. How do you do?
We have that in common.
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
Bill-
Huh?
Where?
Show me a human and I might have!
That I am...
Then you're crazy.
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
She did...?
It won't play.
I thought you were going to be late-
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
For instance what?
Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
I will not calm down!
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
Well, I am.
Don't be condescending.
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
What would you like? Texas?
Groom.
I don't have to. I want to.
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
I just asked a simple question.
Are you proud of me, Bill?
Is that what you want me to be?
Your make-up's a little heavy.
You're quite a girl.
You hear all kinds of things.
What did you expect - live sables?
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
Buy some.
Oh, brother.
See you home...
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
You don't like Eve, do you?
Why not?
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Well...
I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
The show must go on.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
There can't be very much-
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was - a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery.  When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home -  and there was a Little Theater Group... like a drop of rain in the desert. That's where I met Eddie. He was a radio technician. We played 'Liliom' for three performances, I was awful - then the war came, and we got married. Eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the South Pacific. You were with the O.W.I., weren't you Mr. Richards?  That's what 'Who's Who' says... well, with Eddie gone, my life went back to beer. Except for a letter a week. One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. I'd saved my money and vacation time. I went to San Francisco to meet him.  Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead...  ... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone, but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco. And one night Margo Channing came to play in 'Remembrance'... and I went to see it. And - well - here I am...
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
Right here.
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
Of course.
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
She's just outside the door.
Three or four miles...
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
What about Bill?
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the station in plenty of time...
I'm beginning to catch up.
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
Nothing...
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
... Among so many quiet qualities.
The play? All right, I guess...
Twentyish. It isn't important.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
You'd have been proud of her.
That's beside the point.
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
--no way--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
Right. Nixon didn't get where he got by being dumb--  --listen, that was a Watergate question--
The fucking New York Times.
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
Anything you've got.
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
That happens to people.  OK, go on.
--shit, who do we know?--
How high up, which Republicans?
--Haldeman I know, who else?
It's nothing personal, though. 
--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
11:30.
Oh.
I'm on deadline.
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
I told you, he had to go out on a case.
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
Chapin did contact you then?
Sure--off the record.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
Can't help you.
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
Give me your checkbook then.
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.
So tell me about the Times article.
Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.
--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
You asking me to disclose my source?
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
Barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then.
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
To where?
The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
No.
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
I really want to know.
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
The head of security for the reelection of a Republican President got caught bugging the national offices of the Democrats? What the hell does that mean?
I can't sell hints to Simons--  --you called everyone you know?  Call someone you don't know.
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
Thanks coach.
Suck me...beautiful?
I'm not good in math.
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
Neither did I!
No idea.
You're gonna shit your pants!
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
Come on!  I won't tell.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way through this.  You better practice.
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
You want onions?
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
You're missing the game for us?!
What?  We both have cars.
That's not why we're going out.
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
Sure.
You mean...and orgasm?
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
Yeah, sure.
Highly, highly overrated.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
She's a mermaid, dude.
Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
Strip?
Nadia, I can't --
This just got a hell of a lot better.
You got in.
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Yeah.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
You've just inherited The Bible.
What's that?
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
That junior chick?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
Exactly.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
I don't know... Surprise me.
Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Like an underground club?
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did.  Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
Now!
Well, I don't have any money . . .
Not you. Him.
Poor Meetoo!
You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
I'm glad you	did too.
No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
Yes, you do. You do.
My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...
Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
This is Alvy Singer!
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Yes.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
Yeah? Allison what?
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Tsch.
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
Well, stop listening to him.
Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
M'm.
Well, then, w-who was?
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta-  whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away... I have to say well. Oh, oh... God, Annie.  Well... oh, well... la-de-da, la-de- da, la-la.
Oh, no, I have a car.
Yeah.
Well, where is it? I-
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
Okay, that's good.
I'll getcha a piece.
Oh.
I'll see yuh.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
Gimme a kiss.
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
Yeah?
M'hm.
Yeah.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
M'hm.
Oh! Italian, right?
No, I'm not.
You- Do you love me?
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Let's just do it, all right?
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
Following is different. I was spying.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
It's his name.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
M'hm.
Yeah.
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
There's a spider in the bathroom.
What?
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
What?
Yeah.
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
yes, we had, uh...
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
Can I confess something?
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
I have a headache.
I can think of another word.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Yeah.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
Who said that?
Sure.  just don't-don't get angry, you know what I mean? 'Cause I-I have - I have my-my license here. You know, it's a rented car. And I've...
You're crazy!
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Forget it, Max.
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
You wanna lie down?
M'hm.
Hi. How do you do.
We're gonna operate together.
Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
SO?
I look pretty.
We really had a good time.
Yeah.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Yeah.
And here, you just-
I was very charming.
Did you know the contractor?
A triumph.  When did you get here?
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
Who, Sally?
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
Why didn't you bring him?
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
Really?
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
I love her too, Joe.
Yeah.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
It's not a contest.
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
I love you, Joe Therrian.
I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  You just need to get into a car and go.
Monica.
Excuse me?
We've heard lots about you.
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Nice to meet you.
Are you my big hard hero?
A perfect night.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Probably not.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
Happy anniversary.
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
We're great.
It's alright.  Be our guests.
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
Well he can't have gone far.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
You walked out on a five year marriage.
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
It's a shit novel anyway.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Don't do this!
I wanted you back.
I'll never forgive you.
You don't have to.
That's under lock and key.
Will you make love with me?
Has she called?
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
I meant Sally.
Oh.  You're serious.
No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink?
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
Hm.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
Trust him.
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
God willing.
Oh?
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
Not at all.
No, never.
That was my clue.
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
You see, that's worse.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
You're a shit.
Yes.  Fine.
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
Nevermind.
Would you like to meet my husband?
You weren't exactly horrified.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Mmm, yes, I see what you mean...
No -- an <u>individual</u>!
Well...  I declared war!
You're right!
You -- you think I'm right?
Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!
Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
Hlllllllp!
Stop fooling around in there.
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Well, "trouble" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.
Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday.  Well, to be honest, I just liked having it.
I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Outstanding.  Princess...?
Duty calls!
Oh, no, sir!
I...I have no idea, sir.
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
Affirmative.
...Not enough food?
Why are we so successful?
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
I can't think of any.
Oh!
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Really?
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
So I see.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
Of course not.
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
Two o'clock.
Where's my dress? I have to go home.
No -- I don't want anything.
And where are you now?
His apartment?
They had to pump it out.
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
Open it.
You don't have to entertain me.
Pick a card.
Gin.
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
Was he really upset when you told him?
You are?
I don't like myself very much anyway.
I just want some fresh air.
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
I really ought to be getting home. My family will be flipping by now.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
That's terrible.
Fine. How's your eye?
Last night?
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Oh?  Oh!
Relax, Baxter.
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
Sir?
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Yeah --
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
Yes, sir.
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
Now hold on, Baxter --
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
I have a vague idea.
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
I'm not sure.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
Good night.
The party's over.
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
Who?
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Dreyfuss.
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
That's right.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
Not very -- but I'm going to be there anyway.
We talked about a lot of things.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
Now, Fran --
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
What's it matter? Get to the point.
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
Well --
We need all our fuel.
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
Now just a second -- I'm doing you a favor, buddy -- what're you trying to pull?
My men --
Men of all races -- nationalities --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
Part.
North ?
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the Delta.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
What are you doing out here?
Cook school -- that did it.
I don't believe you --
Let's go.
I'll go with him --
I saw that Colonel's Huey on the point --
Maybe.
Charlie?
I am not presently disposed to discuss that, sir.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
What?
Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that --
What?
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
What are you doing?
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
What?
Yeah... thanks.
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
Sure.
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.
You're Australian?
So Kurtz is alive.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
We're going ashore. Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance.
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
Cognac?
Beverly Hills --
139  CONTINUED:
It'll be interesting, trying to build a fire without any wood.
How did she..?
Be careful -- there're two of them.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
Do I want to be with you permanently?  Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live?  That I don't know. C'mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was totally
I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Come here...
I'm staying.
I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
Leave my traps.  We'll tag up, couple days.
New to the country, kid?
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
A daughter in Oregon.
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.
I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.
I'm here to do my job.
Yep.  Sometimes they do, but usually they end up crazy or dead.
Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
You broke the radio, remember?
I'm sure she's fine.  Seemed like a clever kid.
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
This isn't your concern.  It's over, here and now.
We'll go with you.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Well, maybe he has nice friends.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
What's with the dark?
You all set here?
I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
My son.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Welcome.
Dancing?
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
It's one idea...
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
Just let me talk.  I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
Yes.  No.
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
Hey -- you called me... I...
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
Where are all your queer party friends?
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
Because...  ... you love her?
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
Right.
So you're from around here?
We both know what you were doing.
What does that fucking mean?
All right, Bain.  Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
Oh, yeah.
Yes, sir.
I'm worried about you, Robert.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
Paid in full.
You didn't know anything about me.
So this is something between you and him?
Forget it!
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
As in daughter of Agamemnon?
What do you want to know?
This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?
Where you wanted to be?
Because you are a women.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
Did it ever bother James Bond?
About?
No.
Thank you.
They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
Sounds pretty well figured out.
You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
I was.
What happened?
What did he want?
No.
Jesus, if someone had --
Did he explain how this happened?
He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up.  And I watched them make love through the keyhole.
Am I attractive?
No.
What?
Electra --
I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
All the time.
I hope not.
Some.
Anything.
That's correct.
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
And not even then sometimes.
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
Well, this place is too expensive so you've had it.
No "if's" or "but's" it's a cinch. Do you want to know what the icing is?
We could make a run for it?
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
'cause you stink of booze.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
Just save me a little patch and I'll do it later.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Don't worry if the old lady's there I'll brick it back up.
Is it gone four-thirty?
Close!
Stealing's stealing, we might as well get what we need. This'll do for the floor and the walkway too.
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
Why don't we go together?
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
You capitalist pig!
He's lying! I am.
Did you see anything in the files?
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Yeah, somewhere?
Yeah, Dave Walters.
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
I've been around.
We should be done by the weekend.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
No, not just yet.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
I hope so!
No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
Can we charge admission?
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
That's only the half of it. I've heard a rumour they're taking over a theatre to use for alternative arts; you know what that means?
Will this thing take long?
How do I know what's being said?
Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.
Sure!
Uh-huh!
Yeah, but it was okay.
Alright!
A kind of freedom.
How do I know this isn't a trap?
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
You really are a piece of work, you know that? You walk out on me and my family for some worthless bum and you expect us to help him when he screws up.
Yes, if you can get him free.
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
Why not?
About a job.
Late night.  You?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
That'd be something.
He wants to talk to you.
Me.
What kind of a man are you, son?
I don't make small talk --
This play -- ?
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Do you think I'm strange?
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
Looking for something -- someone.
No.
It's not.
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
I wanted this to be a date.
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Where?
No. Why? Are you seducible?
Sure.
Yes, one of many.
I'm not applying to college.
Pull over.
I was going to fake it.
It was a play.
Dad --
No. I want what's best for you.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
Like what, sir?
Either. Both.
I thought she built it herself.
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
Yes. You?
I want to come back.
How would you do that, Mr. Carter?
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
You came here to give me my report card?
Yeah.
This is 1952....?
No....
Have we ever met before?
You do?
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
Why?
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
Operator, what's today's date?
Pro! Release the rope!
Is Shemp all right?
No! Don't tell me!  I don't want to know the future! My knowledge of future events... your mere presence here... could have devastating effects on the course of history. And altering history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear. My immediate response is to send you back to your own time.
You were ringing the doorbell!
Jesus!
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
Professor, if something does go wrong tonight... if I don't get my parents back together... when do you think I'd cease to exist?
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
Hi, Marty!
Not bad.
Okay.
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
Is that right?
Yeah? Why not?
Nah, I got me a job.
He'll say that?
Yeah.
Well, I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... I've got to run.
I know.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Just don't... I've got a headache.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
I don't care.
You said that once already... Too late now.
How's he doing?
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Yes.
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know.
Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I?
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
No.
Who're you?
It?  Who does?
Where's the professor?
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
He offered you money?
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
Pretty terrible shot.
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it like out there in the real world?
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
John Whorfin will kill us!
Should we be on Code Red?
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
How about you? Will you be alright?
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
What are they like? What are they about?
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
Garland, it's me.
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
It's still a little early for me.
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected –
...Barton, is everything okay?
Well, I'm just asking. You sound a little –
Well, you just... sound a little–
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
Doesn't surprise me at all.
And I could tell you some stories –
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
Frequently played, seldom remarked.
Seen a doctor?
No, I guess you're stuck with the one you've got. Have a seat.
Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. In my experience, they pretend to give it, but it's generally a smoke- screen for demanding it back – with interest. How about family, Bart? How're you fixed in that department?
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor – though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong – Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
That's all right, really –
So they say.
I've gotta call the police – or you could call for me –
Hold on –
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to –
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
I apologize, Barton.
I tried to show you something beautiful.  Something about all of US –
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
How's about it, Bart?
Were you drinking?
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
Thank you.
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
Yeah?  Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.  But take my advice.  Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
I don't need any help.
Did you leave the club with him?
That's right.
You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
They were drug buys.  I was a vice cop.
There's a name from the past.
Only in theory.  You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice.
Do you?
Not me.
To see if I can get away with it.
Do you want her to join us sometime?
Did you like her to watch?
Make love to me.
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
I did, too.  She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
No thanks.
Somebody has to die.
I told you.  She kills him.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
He was murdered.
It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
That's him.
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
I never heard of him.
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
They're executives.  They're nervous about everything.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
She said alone -- suite 405.  It ain't gonna take long.
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
What about me?
You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
I'm a painter, too.
See ya in an hour.  So what do you think?
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
What's wrong?
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
You name it, I paint there.
Sure.
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
That's the same guy who did this painting.
I hate this. Turn that off.
Not what?
Yeah... Maybe just his arms.  Put some Cerulean Blue there.
Still not here.
SAMO.
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
Thanks.  Your dad called again – something about a job.
'Uppity?' Like as in 'uppity nigger?'
You don't have any fucking money..
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
I'm your family.
Don't you think he's using you?
Pretty much the same.
What's that about?
What's his name?
I'll take it.  Andy, gimme three thousand dollars.  Just the caviar – I'll get the rest.
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
That's great.
Wanna Mac?
Have a Mac.
You don't even know me. I want real respect.
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I just don't think you're being fair.
I need this?
That's ignorant.
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
"Shreck's."  You --
Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
What're you really after?
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
And it's not even accurate ... I mean, "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
PMS.
All is shrill, all is blight...
Max, elections happen in November. Is this not late December, or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
It is the hearts of two good men whom I have had the honor of calling son.  Take it, child.  But I implore you, never open it.  You look so like your mother.
There's a lovely inn just down --
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
What seems to be the problem?
Women.
First Ivy had an intoxicating effect on both Dick and me.  Tonight my feelings spread to someone else.
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Alfred's happy here.
Be ready for anything.
Mr. Freeze.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
I see you knew him.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions.  So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment.  Got me?
I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
<		Maybe it's something in the water.
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
Hold it.  You never said anything about a wife, frozen or otherwise-
Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
I've got to stop him.
What do you mean?
I think they're getting worse.
It's a wonder you sleep at all.
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
Is he all right?
Actually, he took the car.
The _Rolls_?
_No_, sir. _The_ _other_ _car_!
What?
How about, MR. E.
Enigma.
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Banzai.
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
Would you? I'm not so sure.
Fast work. You just moved here.
What?
I don't want to remember!
I don't-.
Excuse me.
Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
...The Box can change their lives.  Our stock coupons will spike.
What say we flip for it?
The coin _wants_ to decide.
Let's see if you bleed green.
About what?
A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
I know. I called them.
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
Better. It's not on the market yet.
No.
... Terror.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
I'll take you home if you'd like.
I wish you'd...
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
I feel naked without it.
In all these years... Why couldn't I see how it wold turn out?
Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne -- We do have laws.
I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.
WHAT??
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Well, you know me.  The more they've got, the less they're worth.  This guy must be the most worthless man in America.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
It's gone.
Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
About Charles...
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.  I have a tale to tell.  And not a happy one.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Howls he getting on with the family?
She's ... well, she's good.
Thanks, David.  Always a pleasure.
Er ... pray tell me why?
Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.  Jen?
Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
Okay.....
And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass.  That suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair.
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
What?
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
Huh huh. We're gonna score now.
Yeah, really.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Huh huh. You mean like this?
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
Huh? Huh huh.
Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score.
Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
Butt-dumpling...
Bunghole...
Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
Uh, we didn't score yet.
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
Well sir, I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here, have a look.
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Who knows?
Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
No, Jane.
Almost.
God... Manchurian Tung oil? There's enough to refinish the gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry wardrobe!
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
Won't?  Or can't?
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
Not really...  what's this?
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
But he didn't.  We've got him where we want him.
Little black party dresses?
W... We didn't know how to make one.
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
The Intermediate Interface chapter on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em out yourself.  It's your house. Haunted houses don't come easy.
Well, we didn't know --
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now.  This house is too big.  It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
Yeah.
Your qu...?  But you're...
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
I cannot believe this.
Otho, can you do it?
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
I thought I saw something.
Viridian?
Viridian?  What is...?
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
Look at the tiny figures.
The attic.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Yes.
No. I like this attic very much.
Your family doctor?
I agree.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
That's good.
Your leg must be getting better.
Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
Oh, I like that very much.
Yes, so do we.
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
Yes, very well, thank you.
Yes, so I've heard, a shame... As you know, we in the Soviet Union have the keenest interest in developments of the First American Financial Corporation... We are pleased to hear that you may fill Benjamin's place should he fail to recover.  Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Thank you.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
Yes. That is correct.
I understand.
Thank you, Ben.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Yes. I would like to do that.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
Oh. Thank you.
Of course. I would like to look.
Is his back feeling better?
Yes, I'm very hungry.
I hope so.
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
Since you were a child?
Correct.
Do you feel well enough for that?
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
... Would you take me on a tour?
Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.
I'm afraid so.
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
May 11th.
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
I'm scared.
I have to go back now.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You've always hated the animals.
What's that?
Us, of course.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
It'll never happen, fuckface.
A better friend.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
No.
No. I understand perfectly.
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Emily Dickinson.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
No, really.
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Please, let me explain.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
I've fallen in love.
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
Impressions? Those are hard.
What kind of circumstances?
Thank you, Floris.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
But of course.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
No you mustn't, my child.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
Why not? I need to get in there!
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
When?
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
No.
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Do you mind?
What the fuck is going on?
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
Derek Mantini!
Captain Mertin, surely I am a God-fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie lady, Captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? So I am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. Why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Not like He punished me.
You remember Halle.
..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK...YOU MY BEST THING.
Baby, don't be like that.
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
May I come in?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
Ya think?
Well, what can you do?
No..No that won't do...
Could be that fall you took.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
Morning, ma'am.
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
I don't believe that. I won't.
There was a rooster named Mister down at Sweet Home. Last time I saw Halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister - sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like king on a throne. He was a hateful thing. Bloody and evil..But he was better than me.  Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named Mister. But wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D. again..Schoolteacher changed me. Was never no beating under Mr. Garner. Schoolteacher changed that. Why wouldn't a man run from that? Why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? And it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else. And that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
She left me. She's gone again.
She was my best thing.
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
Yeah, okay.
Uh?
He looks like a fuckin' loser.
You're not dealing with morons here.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Shit.
Fuck you.
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
Yeah, but we're--
I am the Walrus.
What the fuck is he talking about?
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
Went alright.  Dude's car got a little dinged up--
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
Where's your car, Dude?
Lebowski on the right?
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
And was there anything of value in the car?
And what do you do, sir?
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say.  Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson".
She most certainly was not!
Dieter Hauff?
Well--yeah, I guess--
What do you do for fun?
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
Well...no, of course not--
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
Yeah, but--
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
What the fuck are you--
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
Well, just take 't easy, man.
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Just for making the hand-off?
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back--
Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
"Our" car, Walter?
Aw, fuck it.
Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson!
Uh-huh.
Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the.
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
Huh?
What's your point, Dude?
You know this!
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?
Yeah, I can see that, Dude.
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
Yeah.
Friends like these, huh Gary.
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
Employed?
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
I came all the way down here same as you did.  Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--  Habla Ingles, Tomas?
Someday.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
I didn't know.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
You don't have to hunt to do it.
Really?  What are we supposed to do, then?  Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live?  What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you justify saving people like that?
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
Well it's in mine, too.  I'm a pureblood.  I wasn't turned.  I was born this way.  Just like you.  Am I evil because I want to survive?  What about a wolf?  What about any predator?
Either that or feeding the worms.
Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
I don't know about this, man --
Human?
You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Going on twenty years now.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.  We were gonna take "E", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  You know the riff, "Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but --"
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
It's because I'm human that I can do this.
The vampire God. This speaks of His return.
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
Preventive medicine.
Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?
There are worse things than vampires out there.
You get used to the darkness.
I've been better --
What are you talking about?
I was afraid that might happen.
What?
Jesus, Karen, you're breaking my heart here --
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
You.
You've been listening in the whole time?
I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
Hey, folklore--
Join the club.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
Yes.
--I'm not staying here!
--Christ almighty--
--whatever; that's her.
--or one huge attack of group hysteria.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
Anna--
Get your goddamn--
--Cotter's--
--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
Why?
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
Yeah.
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
--no, I think they're all in there.
--go!
Four in the morning?
Why does everyone here but me have have a gigantic stick up their ass?
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
No.
What're you, nuts?
--coming out of the water--
--Domini!
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
This isn't about us.
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be <u>just</u> the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.
--shit!!!
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
What?
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
Sure. I'm sorry.
--a <u>lot</u>.
Anna--
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
I am?
Well I do...
Sort of...
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
Yeah.
Ray--
What do you want to know?
I think someone's watching.
Give Debra here another drink, and give me the usual.
I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years.
Yeah...
Yeah.
You owe me for two weeks.
...What?
Nah, I trust ya.
How would I know?
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Tuesday.
I've seen a few.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
You did? A human ear?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
You want to see him too, right?
Yes, but.
Then, shut up!
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Bull.
Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
Oh yeah, that's good.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
You said hello. to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. and something about a Meadow Lane. something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
THEN WHAT?
Never before this.
No.
Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
Come on Dorothy.
Sometimes I think I do.
Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Don?. Where is he?
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back. 
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
Good, let's drink up.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
How is Central these days?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
Brilliant.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
That sounds good.
O.K.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
Yes.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Shoot.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
You didn't tell him about me?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
Just a minute.
Dorothy Vallens?
Hey Jeff.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Good deal Dad.
Nothing. I'm fine.
Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
... Stop it Mike.
On the plane.
Yeah.  I am.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone.  For you, and you, and you.
We want some grass.
It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
For calling you a homo.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
I would if I could get some sleep.
No, no.  That is where you are wrong. For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN Miami, we sell for sixty.
Congratulations, brother.  I've been waiting for you.
How are we doing?
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
Okay.
It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
I love you too, man.
This is not the time, Diego.
I did not.
Coke.
Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat!  This man is having a heart attack.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Mexico.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
Oh, I see.
It would be my pleasure.
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
People tell me that I am crazy.  That my business will never work in your country.  What do you think, George?
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Beautiful girls?
Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
How are you doing?
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
Yeah, sure, whatever.
Yeah.
Where are you going?
After everything.  After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you.
Who's the co-pilot?
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
What?
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just looking at it.
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Which "district" do you belong to?
What "group"?
What ... What must I decide?
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
No. Not you, or any one of us. As long as we are free, the NLF continues to exist in the Casbah. If they manage to take us too, there won't be anything left ... And from nothing comes nothing ...
It's a question of habit ...
Why?
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
But it's not even midnight yet!
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
Of course I am.
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
Yes ... But let me first see you.
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty slick.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
He can remember at least one occasion -- and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the office.
What about the will?
Any prints on the nasal spray?
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
Did they argue the day before he died?
You may call your next witness.
Counsel approach the bench.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
You get his statement?
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
I had some papers to pick up.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
No -- never.
Yes.
Intense.
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
What did she say?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
We stopped seeing each other.
We had dinner at a restaurant.
No.
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Yes.
What did you prescribe for her?
A previous witness stated that she saw Miss Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty-eighth.  According to your records when did you prescribe the drug?
He did.  Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough  -- and well...
Yes -- cocaine.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Yes.
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
No.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
Then you would have gotten your money?
Frank -- what are you doing here?
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
This is a very small town -- people here have very straight views on sex.
I am who I am.  I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are.  I like sex different -- I like it wild.  That's not a crime.  I loved Andrew.  We made love together.  We made it differently, but we still made love.  It was our way.  It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice.  If I was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me?
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
No -- it just doesn't look right.
Oh -- Well, they're different.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it?  To let go of what you want?
You and me -- making love.
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
She's mistaken.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Why would she lie?
It's only the beginning.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
That wasn't the deal.
Don't listen to him.  Can't you see he's trying to turn you against me.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
She's waiting in the conference room.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
Really?
If you want me to.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
Why don't you talk to him now?
No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
It's more involved than that.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
What time did you leave?
Well, that's a long time.
No treasure maps, huh?
What?
Don't say that!
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
I'll get right on it.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
That must be it. It's a great smell.
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
Oh! You caught me.
WHAT!
Sure.
Not at all.
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Is the dizziness gone?
I don't think you're normal.
Why did you stop?
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
What?
Francesca?
What?
Woman friends, too?
But no one in particular.
No. But I love them just the same.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
I want you to come.
Have you ever been to that station?
Yes.
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in. 
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
Stop it!
No one's asking you to!
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
It's only four days.
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
I was paying the check. She ran outside. I told her to wait for me right here! Oh God, where is she? Rebecca!
Apparently just before her death.
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
I know damn well she's there.
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
Died there?  How?
Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Your father.  He was your father.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
Fine.  Maybe I got nothing to lose. 'Cept you.
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
Believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
You haven't?
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
Two point one seventy-six.
Admit what?
Where is it?
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
I told them to run it through the cycles.  But I guess Gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up.
Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take five minutes.
But you know he did it.
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
Caesar, maybe we should run --
Caesar, what are you going to do?
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
I don't know.  We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Shut up, Violet!
You need the money just like we do.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
Go right ahead, sir.
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
What?  They ain't there?
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back.
Are they really?
Yeah.
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
'63 Chevy.
Caesar is your husband?
What do you want?
Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
Maybe.
How long have you been with him?
So am I.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
What was it then?
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
Why?
Has Caesar ever seen him?
He does it right in front of him.
What did Gino drink?
Shit!  Oh shit!
You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
What happened?
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
Turn?  To who?  Where does he turn? What does he have to offer?  He's got nothing.  He's a killer.  He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
So now you know.
I don't think so.
Jason Bourne is dead.
You have your passport?
Yeah, I know...
Who?  Who came?
Did you?
I hadn't heard.
Oh, Jesus... 
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
You don't want the police any more than I do.
Listen to what you want.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
I don't know.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
Where are we?
I guess.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
Who paid the bill?
What is that?
Go back to the hotel.
xxxxxx
We have to keep moving.
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
<u>Where am I</u>?
Thank you.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
Got there!
...sabotage!
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
He will be pleased when he comes home.
David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
Yes, well, from the Department's point of view you're certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
Triplets.
What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
Christ! You do know it all!
I'm sure you have
Yes. I'm impressed.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Yes.
Stamped?
Information Adjustments.
Don't look back! Act naturally!
Good!
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
It's my fucking life.
Why?
What?
No, really.
Really.
Who is this war against, Sam?
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
You're joking.
I thought you arrested me.
Turn!
Shit! The house is on fire!
Don't do anything silly.
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
I delivered it.
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
I know that.
Sam Lowry.
I want to talk to him.
Er, yes ...
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
Hello. Mr Lowry?
We'll be back.
What?
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
What if there is no tomorrow?
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
I can't hold up my head anymore.
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
What?
No.
I'll be right down.
How is she?
Sleeping.
He's better.
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
We moved out after that. Upstate.
You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
Don't seem so bad to me.
It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here. 
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular off and on, hasn't been in in a while. He seized and almost coded--I gave him a hypertonic solution. He drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. One for the textbooks.
What do you think?
The family know?
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
Crazy fucker.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die.
Why?
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
You learn that in the army?
Turn here. You missed it. The Chink is on 3rd.
You know what. The radio.
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
You write this?
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
What's wrong with it?
I'll find some copy.  Be right back.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Why do you say that?
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
I didn't know you were going with him.
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
Then what was good about it?
This isn't friendship.
What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around?  Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm semi-serious here.  He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.  And he'll get all the great women.
Sit down, stop.
I just found out.  You didn't say anything to me?  You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
Well -- my wife got this new job...
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
We have a minute and a half.  It's my responsibility to tell them we won't be ready.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
Let me hear it!
Should I...
Bad manners.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
No...no.
Yes.  How do you know?
What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this.  Sorry. Go ahead.
Okay, sweetie.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Me!
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
I knew what you meant.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Okay...It's so good to see you.
Go ahead -- what?
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
Through the closet.
I'm going home!
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
I'll pose any way you want.
Not really.  One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
He made a cat.
Of course...it's wonderful.
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
I do the research.
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
I know, man.
Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
Well do some looking around the room. I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
You want me to open a window or something?
It was.
Yeah?
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
Huh?!!!
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Well I'm overjoyed.
Then let me give you something then...
I had him in my grasp.
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
Let me in.
Don't tread on the earth?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
Come on, what was it?
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
You broke up with my machine?
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
You guys are thrashed.
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
Yeah?
You know, you saved my life.  And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.
Come again?
What for?
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
He did what he was supposed to.
You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait.
Like my homework.
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Kimberly, it's the senior dance.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Skip it.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
Here?
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
Oh, fuck you!
I...
Football is my life.
I was just scared is all.
Thank you very much.
Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan.  He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth.  They are a plague upon us.
Oh, baby!
You're kidding.
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
What is she...
Like we don't have rights too?
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
I'm, like, yelling at her, 'What are you doing?'  And she's going 'Jeffrey, Jeffrey!'  Way mental.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
You said "Crash".
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
It's all the same thing.
What'd he say?
it's okay..
Oh--won't YOU come in?
You don't have to...
--but you're father's in there!
Don't worry.
We all deserve to wear white.
I'll learn.  C'mon--
I'm not interested yet.
Yep.
So...Wanta make love?
But they're nice hips.  I looked up your records-- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home.  Don't you see?  If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
You got a live arm there.
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
You a God damn witch?
You spit on me!
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
What do I got?
Yep.
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
I won't have to.
God--what a Big League move.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
Yep.  So how's Annie?
No.
No.
Fear and ignorance.
I'm getting too old for this game.
Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.
What?
Hello, Senator.
He's lying.
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
Philip, if you would rise.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
Hold on a second.
Matter of fact...
Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.
You know, I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to. The Gaming Commission would never give me a license. I have at least two dozen gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.
Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy.
Hey.
Yeah.
And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
Nope, there's no way.
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
No, I don't wanna come -
Fine.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
Yeah.
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
...to me.
That's right, yeah.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
The problem was, Nicky was not only bringin' heat on himself, but on me too. The FBI watched every move he made. But he didn't care. He just didn't care.
Yeah.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
No, I'm not okay.
I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
You bet.
She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of her fucking mind.  Do you unders-
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
What, are you trying to handicap me?
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
Yeah, I know all that.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
I'm not crying. 
You're with me now.
Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
What are you talkin' a- ?
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
I didn't take your pills.
You can't make me stop caring...
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.
It's under...
...twenty-five thousand?
Okay?
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
Let go of me! Let go of me!
You threw it away?
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
Just wait there for me!
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
If she calms down...
But it was just mine.
...and hypocrisy.
How many kids do you have?
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
God! 
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Hi. Good.
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
You can't talk to me like...
Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!
Yeah?
Is that what you did?
Tell him to go fuck himself? You fuckin' hick!  Fuckin'...
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
Yeah. Fuck him.
Great!
Stay out of the way!
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
He's good. He's fine.
Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
I'll be right out.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Yeah, no shit.
Sure.
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
I do.
He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
It's all right.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
Yes, you are.
What about my money?
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
But I saw something...
What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't steal anything from you.
Okay?
I am.
No, Lester.
Do you know that?
He's sittin' by the phone -
You're driving me nuts!
...they're in Penthouse K.
Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
Get up.
This is Nick.
Go fuck yourself.
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
Oh, he ain't nobody.
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You know that? Bad fuckin' spot.
Fuck you!
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
Mr. Chairman -
Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head.
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
Then do it the way you want.
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
You have to dial nine first.
That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
We'll hunt him down together...
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
What about "climbing in?"
Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...
Well. I stand corrected.
What's the matter with you, Spooky, my most trusted comrade?  We are warriors!  These are the challenges we live for!
Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
Did you just say "girls?"
What's the name of your child's best friend?
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
But I'm blind.
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Trust me, you won't have to.
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
Matter of fact I did have a kid once.  But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.
I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
Or relieve me of it later.
I'm the one they'd be looking for.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Any minute.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Then hang up!  Do it!
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
What makes you say that?
Stop throwing names at me.
Black Mercedes, 600S.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Do you know what's in that box?
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
God, if he doesn't come back --
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
Include me in that.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.  It's all there isn't it?
There isn't any such person.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
There was <u>no</u> cop involved.  Oh shit!  Fuck!
A typical fuck-up.
You're enjoying this too much.
He wants 75 back.
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Only one way to find out.
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Sure.
I wish it had never been invented.
And not a nickel.
Are you trying to panic the women?
I'm backing up.
Put the girl on.
I think I've already had a "quickie."  Thank you.
Sure, I end up with some cash. And a lot of bonds I don't know how to dispose of.
Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends.  Tighten your belts.  Here it comes.  Ready?
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
In your dreams.
Are you busting my chops or what?
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Hold on.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
Thanks.
What would you call it?
Hi, Jimmy.
Fuck it, is what I say.
Maybe.
How'd you guess?
The accent, I suppose.
Hi. You forgot your bag.
How special?
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
What does that mean?
Yeah.
I'm thinking of your man.
Dil --
Don't call me that.
Sure I do.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
You think that's wise?
Make it up to me, then.
Will you meet me again?
Are you pretending yet?
Not at all, honey.
She's the thing you had to tell me.
You could say that.
It's a secret.
For you...
Look on it like a honeymoon.
My pills...
Only in times of extreme stress.
You knew my Jody?
You didn't.
Got to be somewhere.
Yes.
Tell me what she wore.
Stop it, Dil --
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
Thirty-five.
Fergus.
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
Aha.
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
Do you want a cup of tea?
You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep.
I told him.
Are you all there?
Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days.
Would make me feel better about it.
Who'd you think it was?
I thought it was Dave.
A hotel?
Hope not.
What do you mean you can't?
You want to bet?
What do you know about my nature?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
What?
Best game in the world.
My pleasure, Jody
Hurry up, would you?
These things take time, Fergus.
Doesn't matter where.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
We don't look on it like that.
Depends on what you believe in.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
Some kinds of women are...
When I was a child...
Got to catch me first --
Hurling --
Hurling --
You never know.
People. They could be looking.
It was fun while it lasted.
Nice lady.
You shut your face --
 I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you. 
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
What are you talking about?
Oh!
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Relax -- you're gaining.
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
Look.
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
I heard you, I heard you.
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
No.
Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
1944. The next face, please.
Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
That's the idea.
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
I'm not fifteen.
Who told you to do that?
I'll be right there.
Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
Hm?
How often do you go through this little ritual?
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
How much is it worth?
The money is unimportant.
What's its value today?
Here's ten.
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
And if it is?
Tell me what?
She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.
I know.  I'm sorry.
And this?
No, Jean-Louis.
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
How's that?
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
I don't know where to go.
I'm still having trouble with English.
You mean you and me?
Having a nervous breakdown.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
Be careful, Peter.
That's all.
So they think he left it with you.
Yes?
You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear?
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
I've never seen him before.
I don't know.  But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
We want that money -- now!
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
You do?
I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
I never fucked Rod.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
She's my daughter, Tom.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
You're grounded Friday night!
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
You are upset.
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me.
She's still a virgin.
I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
I'm sure you should have failed.
You think you're my sister?
Mark Shale.
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
What?
Yes?
What?
Don't make me order you.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
You didn't believe her?
Why not?
Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
Hi Sandy.
Now don't be nervous.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
What?
ROD!
Okay, okay.

Freezer in the back.
Art.
That'll make up the difference, huh?
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.

It happens to this piece of shit...
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
You stole this truck! That's...
 Shut up.
...-damn!
Take your gun!
What?
Doesn't...
 Nice job back there.
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
Oh!
Oh, shit.

...Shift.
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
Oh, shit.

Oh, shit.
 Oh...
...Pete.  Come on.

I made it!
You okay?
Shut up!
Come on.

Taking it down the hill.
What?


You know what I'm sayin'?
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
So you took his...
We were nationally  ranked.
Started every game my senior year.  Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  Got taken in the first round.
...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this...
Yeah, baby!


 Okay.

Arlo!

 I'm sorry.  I'm a little 


Come here.

Hang...
...tunnel!
 What's it say? 

They'll meet you at the top.
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
You.
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
I was undercover as a tennis player.

To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
I'll keep an eye out.
...within five minutes.
Listen, shithead!
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?
I had no idea how powerful it was.
Sure as hell have met a few assholes like that, though.
...owe you.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
Now, I know.  You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
No!
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
Pleasant surprise.
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...
Tell the choppers we're lifting off!
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.
We're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
...screwup?
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
I beg your pardon?
Your fellow hero, untouched...
I would've in another life.
Goddamn it, Ma-...
 ...ready before the morning crowd blows in.  I got it...
Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
There's something else too.
EXT. DAM - DAY.
It must've happened right after we left.


He's brains without ambition...
Tie a fly...
...back...
Shit!  Oh, shit. 
 ...or it'll ignite. 
 The only one who understands what this me-...
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
Where are you now...
...Mason?
...tunnel!
So you don't remember...

The Army, sealin' us in.
EXT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
INT. TUNNEL/AIR VENT - DAY.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
They're calling it an accident.
Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
We worked in Chinatown together.
That's too bad.
Too bad?
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
My daughter.
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
How did you find out?
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
Who do you blame for that? Her?
Curly, where's your car?
Where's that?
Curly, you know how long I been in business.
Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
I get by.
Well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and I guess you have.
Who?
You're welcome to try. There he is.
No. It was an accident.
Let me show you something.
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
I want the rest of the pictures.
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
I guess not.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
No.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
That's not his apartment.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
It wasn't much of a lie.
Where you were when your husband died.
Yes... why?
No reason.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Another satisfied client's wife.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.
What dam?
They may not know it but they are.
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
Why?
Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
Working for the District Attorney.
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
You saw my fa... father? When?
There hasn't been a lot of time.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
I want to see her.
...no...
Katherine.
She's my daughter.
You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
Where can we go?
Sure, but I'd like to handle it.
But, Mr. Gittes.
Ida Sessions.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Never?
What about the water?
Drowned, too.
Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon.
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
He's not in, Mr.?
It's personal. Has he been out long?
He was expecting you?
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
What about?
Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
That's for sure.
You don't say?
So I can have these? 
For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
Yes. 
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
No, nobody came. 
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Hi. Why are you running?
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
Then where's the money?
You shouldn't tell me that now. After all these years!  I put all your things in here. Go in, go in...
OK...
Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice.
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
Huh?  Oh, I forgot - you've been away so long I forgot about your joking -
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher!
Yes -
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Kane?  Charlie?  Where is he?
Ask them to sit down.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
As a matter of fact, we sent a man to the Silverstone home yesterday afternoon.  Our man even arrived before the "Chronicle" reporter.  And there's no proof that the woman was murdered - or even that she's dead.
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
Is it good?
I know that, Emily -
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
If you're asking me to sympathize with him, Brad, you're wasting your time.  There's only one person I'm sorry for, as a matter of fact.  That - that shabby little girl.  I'm really sorry for her, Brad.
Charles.
It may not be about anything at all.
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
Would you sing for me?
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
At night?
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
Lock it - and keep it locked.
Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
A wasted day.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
Charlie!
What?
I'll get you some coffee.
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
That's the train with all the lights.
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
That must have been love.
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
Yes, sir.
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother?  You don't believe me, but it's true.  It just happens to be true.  He was really interested in my voice.  What are you smiling for?  What do you think he built that opera house for?  I didn't want it.  I didn't want to sing.  It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him.
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
You two better quit it.
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed.
Well... kind of, sort of?
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
There's more, isn't there?
You don't have anything to do with it.
You lie.
Look how full of yourself you are.
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
Jesus, you're caustic.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
You have a better suggestion?
Sang.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
Like what?
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
Um... I don't know.  What time did hockey end?
We did.
Then who operated the store?
Pack of cigarettes.
In a second!
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
Well, he missed!
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Yeah.
What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
I thought Redding had like three balls!
What smells like shoe polish?
Go open the sore.
I can't stand a voyeur. I'll be back.
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
Why?
You win.
Eight and a half?
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
That's cheating?
Oh yeah.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fiancé.
The Emperor.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
FUCK!
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
You've had sex with a dead person.
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
I don't want to talk to you.
If you must.
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
What?
Five hundred dollars.
I don't; you did.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
You're happy to get a fine?
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
What responsibility?
It's the same thing with Veronica.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
How do you figure?
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
Excuse me?
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
I don't know.
See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
No, she's getting married.
I'm not dealing.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
She's my girlfriend.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
So I'm told.
Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet paper you got back there?
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
Why do you say that?
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
How flattering.
And I actually date you?
Something wrong?
How many?
How many what?
Twelve.
No; who were the three, besides me?
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
He gets off on it.
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
I'm going to class.
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
And that made you feel better?
Sure.
Good.  I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
Randal...?
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Now feel his.  Roll up your sleeve, chief.
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
You hope what feels good?
Screw you!
How long you gonna be here?
I... I don't know what to say.
You're not?
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Twenty bucks?
Twenty bucks.
Bye. 
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
That woulda been cool.
More bang for the buck.
I don't know.
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
There wasn't time for anything else.
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
Sure you can.
You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
I don't expect you to understand.
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Which could maybe what?
Where?
And I can't leave.
What if he can't?
What about you?
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
A simple yes or no would have done.
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
Helluva time for vanity!
We were going together before I ever let go of you.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
It looks like a winding route.
Half a day.
<u>Negative</u>.  The winds are too high.  I'm going to ride out the storm here.  I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
These are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause.
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
There, what's that place?
I haven't even got on it yet.  Let's go, time to fetch.
I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
Good morning, Walt.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
Impossible... I don't believe it.
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
You've not been to school all week, son.
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
Just a manner of speech, sir.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
What crime did you commit.
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
Well - I'm back.
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
... and this... He pulls Alex's nose.
I'm gonna be sick.
Crime?
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Through there for a bath.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
Fucking hell...
That!... Using Ludwig van like that! He did no harm to anyone. Beethoven just wrote music.
No, no, boy. You really must leave it to us, but be cheerful about it. In less than a fortnight now, you'll be a free man.
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?
Thank you.
First Friday of the month?  Linens. Roll right off the trucks.  They're in and out in twenty minutes...  ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago.  Traffic will be smooth.
You got a deal.
Big case?
Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
In my office?
Yes!  Stay put, goddamn it!  Don't move from that spot...
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
You're kidding me.
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Unbelievable...  ...you hearing this?  Unbelievable.
Of course.
...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
Pick me up in five minutes.
No harm done, ma'am.
Vincent...
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
Who is this?
Hang on.  Carefully...
...oh, bullshit!  He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
Oh.  Sorry.
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
You on some kind of work plan?
You mean like benefits?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
I can't believe this.
Believe it.
People in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Draws attention, which is something you avoid in my line of work.  And for <u>you?</u> You attract attention, you're gonna get people killed who don't need to be.
I never learned jazz.
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
Oh, I'm captivated.
Don't start.
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
Makes two of us.
You do impress me, Max.  That you do.
Who's Heller?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
And you believe me...?
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
Slow down!
Let her go.
Look, I'm sorry --
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Do you still ride?
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
You saved my life.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Them who?
I noticed.
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
You watch me, don't you?
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
Not today.
Connecticut.
You go.  Send me a postcard.
Did you kill my father?!
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
I'm sorry.
Now she tells me.
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
I don't know...
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
Excuse me?
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
Yes, that's right.
I want this box rigged with a beacon!
Then this is a goddamn emergency.
No.  Not yet.
And Jonas?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
Anything happening in there, El?
What?
Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
What?
Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
Is that your official response?
Okay, okay... there.
Okay.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Now... you go home.
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
Not if you think like a Vegan.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
I think it is your naivete I like best about you, Eleanor.  Oh, there'll be a worldwide protest, but we all knew it from the very beginning.  You Americans discovered the signal, you led the decryption effort.  The machine is being built on your home soil... Of course the passenger will be an American, chosen by Americans.  Anyway, it is what the whole world wants, no?  This is the big show. The sort you put on better than anyone.  It's good marketing.  It's good casting.  It's the American way.
They can't.  I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
The V.L.A.?
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet.  For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive.
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
How do you mean?
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
Prove it.
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
I can't do this --
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
For managing the truth.  But the truth won't be managed, sir.  It stops being the truth the moment you try.
Have your department make a full report.
Cut that backsass!
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
I'll make it a dollar.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
Here, Mom.
What went wrong?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Yeah.
I... I... I...
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
I'll give you fifty cents.
Mister Cool Hand here is the soft heart in our Loan Department. Next!
Pair'a nines.
'Bout two hours left.
A cold drink? Okay?
Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
Do we even get our same bunks back?
Oh mah baby Luke.
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
Cuter.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Damn.
Well, how far didya get?
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
None of your fucking business.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
Then, why don't you just die.  I'm going.  They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on.  Make up your mind.  Live or die.  I'll get coffee.
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
Yes.  I believed him.
I was?  How you spell that?
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
How do you know that?
That's exactly... I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
Why should I trust you?
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
You do that one, I don't want it...
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
Over here.
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
Because it's your job, that's all.
You're shitting ion your career.  You outrank hi...
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
You came in there with this attitude...
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
"Spokes<u>person</u>."
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
I'll listen for you buzzing over.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
You should have gone to the funeral.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?
One of my suitors.
They said it was here. They told me this morning.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
No.
I'm sure the police would make an exception in your case.
Are you still involving me in your crash?
Hard to say.
The case could be made.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
She said she'd be here at 10.
Really?
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
I didn't say...
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
Will you get time off to do that?
Come on.
You've only known Jake a few months.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
Paul said he'd call the school.  And your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
Don't be fresh.
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
Mottled really.   Green and red.
Terrific.
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
Anything interesting.
I've already checked it out 17 times.
Don't be ridiculous.
What's my rap?
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
Tell the doctor.
Do you?
Michael, I...
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
And did you go to the mission?
No, I need some serious household advice.
Aren't you ever quiet?
It's sex time.
You've got one hell of a great body.
I couldn't even face that one.
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
I think I should call someone.
I guess so.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.
I don't feel like going to work today.
Yeah.
Something you did?
I just wish we'd done it sooner.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
I've met someone else.
Here's the ring.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
Wired?    I ain't wired.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
You're there now?
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
How about if I call you?
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
No problem.
We can't.
Cops?
And the Vodka.
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
You didn't buy batteries?
I thought they came with batteries.
I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
I'll be Elvis and you--
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
I will.
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Go where?   The police are outside.
I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
I see. Well, get back out on the street and find them before I "sort of" kill you.
Yeah.   It's mine.
I know where she went.
He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
Glenmorangie is very good.
We don't know that for sure.
Tonight.
Something like that.
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
I didn't have the heart.
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Tell me, who is your master?
I'll never live as a thief!
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
No, really?
Yes, from the West.  He went undercover and and followed her here,
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
You coward!
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
I am a man.  And now I've found the brightest star of all.
You were enlightened?
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
What about you?
Save your strength.
We must avenge mother!
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
I knew that.
The others are called Skank, T- Bird.  Street names.  Funboy.  Watch me, office Albrecht.
I saw it, too.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
Who?
Oh.
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
Shelly?
Miss her?
Yes.
You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all.
Fine with me.
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
"Our" Crow...?
Annette Harrison.
You heard me.
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
On my mother's life.
Okay...
You've read The Fountainhead?
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
No thank you.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
And you promise to abide by it?
What?
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
I'm... I'm alright.
Okay?
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
I love you.
But you knew this was important to me.
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
Margarita found them while cleaning your room.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
Okay.
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
It's Kathryn.
Well did you like it?
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
You think he'll like it?
My mom? Don't call my mom.
You promised to let me kiss you.
Some other time, Cecile.
No.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
You do?
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Who told you?
Jesus!
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
Yes!
She bought it.
What do you mean?
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
You don't mean?
She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
What's your plan of attack?
Take a look for yourself.
Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley.  Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book.
Nothing.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
So? How'd it go last night?
Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in.
Oh come on. For her first time?
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
Annette?
Come again?
You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.  Cheers.
Will you calm down?
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
Absolutely.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Excuse me.
I guess that puts me in my place. Thank you for the hospitality Mrs. Caldwell. It was a true awakening.
Do you know when she'll be back?
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
You're a lucky guy.
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
Oh, lots of times.
But it's already come true.
Irena.
All right, mommy.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
You're shouting at me.
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
That's the Farren house.
Where did you mail them?
Certain wishes do.
Can't you tell me later?
Let me be the judge of that.
This one hasn't got a name on it. Who's this one for, Amy?
I don't know yet.
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
You called me by my name.
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights.
May I pet the deer?
She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
I'm trying to.
But she's such a nice lady.
But I don't want you coming here alone. You get me to go with you when you want to come here. You promise?
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
But it was alive — it was fast and strong!
Good.
Yes, yes -
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Go on -- out with you.
And Amy mailed them?
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. Was there surgery involved?
Don't apologize. It's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
It's not just in my head.
Does she have PMS?
Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt.
And she got the medium.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
Holy shit, I'm a freak.
Did I kill him? Of course not!
He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him!
And then?
Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
What the hell is the tampon test?
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
Okay. I guess so.
I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.
It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
I haven't gotten it yet.
Yeah, I guess. Mark?
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
No.
Ignore it.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
Sure. See ya.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
You never say that.
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
Script coverage?
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
Okay.
Oh, I see... interesting theory.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
I don't know. I don't remember doing it.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
No, it was our first date.
Take some allergy medicine.
We can just take this pillowcase.
Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
And he was missing an arm.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
And fifth, you're dating her.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Nope.  No maps.  Ocean, huh?  On vacation?
Yeah, Iím like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure canít complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this ainít no fucking rug! Gíhead.  Feel it!  All mine!
Sorry, sir.
Fine.
Well be more careful, please.
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
Yes.
But I...
I see.  The verdict, yes...
Water?
I'm nothing then.
Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
Why?
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
You're kidding?
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
I mean,  if it's a problem...
Nightmare...
Bob...
Bob, the guy had a stroke!
Up and around?  Soon?
Is that everybody?
And...
Nobody's got clean kids.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
What I told him to?
Bob...
So what do we do?
Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an `incident'  really...
Really?   Crazy?
In the car.
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
Dave...
And it's proving quite effective...
Really?
My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.
Really?
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
No... They don't kid.
Uh...
Since when do you care about the homeless?
I don't understand.
Oh, I don't think so.  Still, you helped a lot of people.
Home.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
What?
I know.
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
Quiet!
That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
You'll find the ways, Miss Mary. And when ya do...we'll sail on over to the mainland...or any other damn mainland fer that matter...and start us a recruitin' program. There's millions o' Bees out there jus' waitin' fer' a General ta lead 'em on ta vict'ry!
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
God....damn you, Rhodes!
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
What is the point?
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
I couldn't stop myself.
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
This is better than sex any day.  This is romance!
To put the rout all that was not life.  And not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.  Pledge Overstreet.
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
What good will that do?
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Dead Poets honor.
Yes sir.
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
I was just looking in an old annual and...
All poetry was acceptable.  The name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
She won't even see me, Pitts.
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
I'm sorry, Neil.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Father, I--
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
That's miles.
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
I don't want to read.
A play, dummy.
So?
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
I guess.
Yea, art thou there?
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
What the hell are you talking about?
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
Who asked any?
Just trying to get to my boat...
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't...
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
A meat locker.
Not like him.
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
Jet ski...there's one left up there.
I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
I don't know...you got what we need?
If I don't, I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe?
Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening.
I have been.
How does an island sound to you?
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
Like Mamooli's country...
I'm looking...
'Cause grease monkey ain't in my job description dick head...
You want 'em?
Fuckin' A!
You're full of shit.
You're full of shit!
I know, but...
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
She does not!
She does, Vince! That's what I'm telling you! She does!!!
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
Married?
What hospital is he in? Where?
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
Everybody love Linda.
Get anything?
Naw.
Oh well! What do you mean Oh well?! The guy is actually... He did it again! That's what he's doing... He... He's reaching in, John, to her --! I'll kill him! I'm gonna kill him right now.
Merle, hey Merle, you got any socks?
No?
Nick, she won't say why.
Oh, Jesus.
You Biederman?
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
Linda, what's the matter?
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
Linda, Linda...!
Would you?
What kind of beer would you like?
C'mon. I've got the car.
The shot?
Hell no!
It's ahead, Vince.
Huh?
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
More bullets in the gun?
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
No. No way!
You wanna bet?
Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!
No!
Yeah.
Sure.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
Yeah.  Least I think so.  Twenty- six years this March.
Good night.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
I'm here.
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
Hospital food.
No you don't.
Says here one of our boys brought him down.  You ever heard of a badge named Wade?
Good to know you, Willy.
We will --
Jabez! Careful --
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
And serve him right!
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Howdy, Hank.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
No, you're not.
Afraid ... of what?
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
Opportunities?
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
1840. Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847.
Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract.
About what?
Not at all, lad -- not at all.  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
There's no joy in it for me.
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Coming.
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
Jabez ...
I'd love to.
Tired?
There is nothing to worry about now.
You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
You'll be a father any minute now.
Sure, Ma.
Wish I could really do something for you. But you know Stevens. He'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you don't pay him tonight.
The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Very well, folks. I accept.
Mary -- Jabez --
Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Ah, fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing.
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.
Hullooo!
Just someone from New Hampshire!
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
It's corny, but I could live with it.
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
Go fuck yourself.
I'm a cop from New York.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
If out plan works...the FBI will get rid of it for us.
When you're hot, you're hot.
Yes, you're right.  It will be done.
Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
You don't want to know.
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
Stand by, Powell.  I gotta check something out.
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
Give me that.  Now, listen to me, mister, I don't know what you think you're doing, but demolishing a building doesn't fall under the definition of 'help'! There's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass --
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
Don't let 'em off the ground.
Well, how'll I get home?
Well.... huh ...
Yeah.  So how are you?
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
You're crazy.
I know!
I like that... yeah!
Shit...
Where are they now?  Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
Well, then...
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
They're okay.
I'm not alone.
What do you want to know that for?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Call me whatever you want.
... armed robbery ...
We're bringing in your wife...

You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
Would I hire you?
Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket.
Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there.
Yeah.
You stopped?  Why?
Because I don't want cancer.
Get 'em in the vault!
But I want to know what you think.
Alive.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
You follow my car. 
We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
... Just give me time to think...
I said you were never a faggot.
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
What'll you do?  Come out.
No!
He's right.  You shoulda done what he did.  Go home.  Don't talk to the FBI anymore.
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
Newsman, not ...
How much?
<i>That's the crew. They follow us.</i>
Did it hurt?
<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
What!!?
Yes.
Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
That's the rumor on the street.
Take us to Vegas.
Chi-Chi has gone to doggie heaven, bitch!
PROVE IT!
Be kind to your sitter.
Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
I said stop it.
Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  And I want to have a little fun.
We dated off and on for two years. But life on the road is tough. The pressure of the tour... relationships within a band... sometimes it leads to jealousy.
Hello?
You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?
Do you know where Danang is?
Just shut up and do what they say. They're gonna kill us if we don't, Ian.
Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.
We can't lose focus of Domino's journey, Mark.
She went up to her room.
<i>House is a wreck/ Gotta collect my check/ Gotta perfume my neck/ But keep yo hands off the weave cuz this black bitch don't suck the dick.</i>
I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?
So, in other words, you are not down.
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. 
I thank you.
Is it a good morning?
We're still standing.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
He's just being nice.
You are too crude.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!
That's right on time.  This is my friend, Vito.  His pops is Sal.
So when is all this ice suppose to melt?
Can ya dig it?
It's dug.
Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
You know you don't get paid till we close tonight.  We're still open.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
I work too, but I still make time.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
You a blue-moon fool.
Trust me.
It's 'pose to be cold.
Later for you.
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
Depends how you define 'new'...
Gotcha.
What? No! Look.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
Wow just like Marco Polo.
You know Mom, like in the pool.
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
I haven't seen you around here before.
Home school. Til today.
Cool.
Oh, is this your special place?
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.
Who's Captain Rob?
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
Shut up!
I will stop this car right now.
Shut Up! Buttlick!
How do you know it's for us?
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
Just wanted to see how your doing.
I bet you want your head scratched.
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
D2.
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
I... found that rock.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
Right.
Well, what should we do?
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
Oh I think you do.
You're just jealous.
I'll talk to you later.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
Uh-oh. Harry?
He passed away three years ago.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Have you got what I want?
Oh yeah, give it to me.
Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.
Yes you are. 
Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
We start our own class?
And, take some more pictures.
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
No you don't know who stole it. Just let me do the thinking.
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
The Emperor's blade.
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
As the legend says.
Excellent!
He knows.
Always?
It burns.
Did they try and fail?
Stop him, Jessica!
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian.  Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes.
Do you want me to get it for you?
No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright.
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
So why didn't you do it?
Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
No, you look good.  And the tests came back fine.  C'mon...
That's great.  Let's do a take.
Perfect.
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
What's to protect?  It was perfect!
And who may you be?
I thought he was dead.
Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait...
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie.  Now that it's done, so am I.
I understand you just moved here?
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
<u>Dr. Acula</u>!
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
I'm real sorry.  My stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... C'mon in, I'll write you another one.
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
OUR picture?
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
How long's he been here?
This is my thirteenth pair.
I am.  How's your father?
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
Well it looks good.  Let's use it!
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
What if I'm vomiting?
Yeah, so... ?
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley.
Yes!
Oh, Al ... This is just...
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
This is real, Bananahead!
Um, yeah -- thanks.
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
Sure.
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth.
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
I'm not sure about the entire concept.
Who?
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Your brother's here.
Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
And what did he come back now for?
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Why? How...
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
All right. Let them decide.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Who's in it?
Right.
Really?
I know, I ...
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
So?
Come on, let's go.
Where?
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
I'm making a tape.
We're excited.
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
You brought the cameras here!
Yeah.
Look, we gotta talk.
Save it.
You know what your problem is?
No problema.  You want a picture?
Hi.
I was in jail.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
What...
Hm?
Sure.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
He likes it.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Do it!
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
Hey, that's super
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
Sporty.
Oh.  Okay.
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
I'm not a dyke, okay, and we're not in love. We were just... I was just experimenting.
So?
I mean at you.
Sure, Tracy.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
Oh.  Hi, Tammy.  I was just, you know, I went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
Yeah.
Do you enjoy it?
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Yeah, I hate them.
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
Of course... But how?
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
I came home that night and there was blood on the floor.  Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself.  They were acting nervous.  And that Stens kept going under the house.
Yeah.  A great big one.
She told you?
Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
What?
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
That's right.
More.
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
Yeah, so...
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
They shot him in his library.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
Answer yes or no.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
That's right.
Glasses.
Give me a minute, will ya?
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
Bud White's been here?
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
Why?
You sound like you mean it.
How about White?
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
Some reality.
I know how he feels.
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
Officer White?
Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
Is she?
And Reynolds?
He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks.  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
They found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk. What about Zavitz?
Yes.
What'd he give to you?
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
I don't know who he is.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
Yes.
Okay.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
No shit.
What if--
I called my wife!
What'd I tell you?
How'd you get around the tap orders?
Jesus. Do you have proof?
They're here.
Why?
You sure?
Fuckin-A.
Goddammit--
How?
Not particularly, no.
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
Well then who can?
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
Is that good?
What size?
I can't.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
Listen to him.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
I've seen it.
"At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
I was missing you.
What is it?
Oh Christ.
Here, you can use this.
Don't count on it.
I don't believe it is, no.
Why the hell would I--
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
Oh.
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
Do you like fish?
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
It's how he works.
Brill?
Yes.
Thank you.
Eat your fish.
She can't talk to you right now.
Because she's reading the newspaper, you asshole.
Are those my Christmas presents?
Sure, go ahead.
In your dreams.
Do I know you?
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
No "900" numbers.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Ssh!
Bobby--
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
My stuff's all over her apartment.
I don't know. I mean--
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Yeah?
Bobby--
Yes. But we can't.
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
The originals?
There was a transfer.
Contact COINTEL. Profile. Assess the threat. Then cross-check against Zavitz. Red-flag the intersects and anything we can exploit. Also NRO. Pull up the keyhole tapes. I need to own him. I need to own him <u>now</u>.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
We believe?
No sir.
If they've looked at the video.
No thank you.
I also have tiny pizzas and mushrooms stuffed with--
You sing.  All the time.
No.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
All true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
Good.
You don't sew at all!
I can't work.  I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
Yes.  A different wife.
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Shall we be all right?
Don't talk.
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
And the people here don't want us. Are you kidding?  The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials…  - isn't that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood.  Isn't that right?
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and…  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
What's the matter with you?
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
You were in Africa?
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
What if I told you he did this to me?
What?  How could he have?  When?
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
I see.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Right.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure…
He needn't disturb you.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
I've met you before.
I've done this.  I've had to do this.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
Kip… I -
I'll always go back to that church.
And what if he really is a spy?
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
Pardon me?
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
Go away.
Yessir.
A more modest expedition, or even wait a year.  Remind our families we still exist.

How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
Who am I?
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
I don't want to waste your time.
Of course I can. I have a note from mother.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
That's my girl.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
Good morning.
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
Charged?
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
Terrified. Still am.
Ready.
Transfer.
Where the money is.
We're doing it tonight.
It was wrong to deceive you.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
I sincerely hope not.
Next time I'll use valet parking.
Don't go getting sentimental. You're no damn good at it.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
This better be worth 1t.
It better be worth it for me.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
It's too soon.
Because it pays off.
Suspicious, after all these years?
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Yeah.  I know.
If you hadn't used profanity --
Out to lunch with the girls.
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
I don't get why they'd do that.
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
Bullshit.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
And that's what caused the contamination?
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
Is that what you want?
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
No, I'm serious.  You know what Kurt Potter is?  He's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place. He's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when PG&E offered 20 million.  He doesn't work like us, Ed.  There's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing.
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
The extortion, the threats ...
I wasn't gonna --
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
Right.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
And ...?
What do you mean?
Heck, yeah.  Come on back.  Just gonna need you to sign in here --
Nope.  Maiden.
We'll see.
Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
I'm gonna go live with George.
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
Why not?
What?  But you been working so hard --
Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of difference.  Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?
I didn't say that.
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
I don't do favors for you anymore.
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
Yeah.  Who are you?
Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other.  I just figured it was something in the genes.  And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that ...
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say they both have some form of cancer.
Yes, My Lord.  We'll find them.
You won't.
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
We're not out of this yet.
Barks his agreement.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
Of course, yes.  But now eat we must.  Good food, I have good food.  Come, come.
She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you.  No one seems to know ...
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
That's quite a compliment.
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
That depends.  Where are we?
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
Me either.  They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.
That's two you owe me, junior.
That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
Not really.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
I didn't say anything?
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
What is it?
I thought you knew this person.
What did you say?!
Snow creatures ... they're here?!
I thought I was in good shape.
That they are.
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
What's in there?
And I too.
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
They suggested oranges.
We know that.
My name is Lewis -- Lewis Dixon .
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
Please
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
I see your point. What's the favor?
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Locked.
The name's Plissken.
Where'd they go?
Looking to get out.
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
Well, I'll think it over.
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
I will not.
I sought only not to harm you, sir.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
Thank you.
...of course...
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?
I have kept it.
There is one.
Love demands it.
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
Just show the sword.
One land, one king! That is my peace!
I swear it.
The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him.
They are not weapons, my friend, but truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your allies will turn against you. Give me the child, Uther, I will protect him. Go back to your war tent.
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
I didn't know that.
Didn't who tell me?
Yeah, well I guess you should've.
Of course I didn't.
No, she was heavily sedated.
Rats?
Well don't go now Karl the stores aren't open yet.
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
What!
A man to see you.
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
She used those words?
Mrs. MacNeil the problem with your daughter is not her bed, it's her brain.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
He didn't mention?
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
No, is Regan aware of it?
It's fine really, sit.
Oh it's so funny.
But you like him.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Well your thinking's not so good.
God gets lonesome for us, Rags. He wants us back.
So what's wrong with her?
I stole it.
I believe you.
I came to say goodbye.
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
You might loosen the straps then.
I'm not Regan.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
No momma.
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
But deliver us from the evil one.
In the face of the enemy.
The Lord be with you.
And let my cry come unto thee.
I once did a paper on it
Very much.
I've seen it.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Are you tired?
O'Lord hear my prey.
Yes.
So?
Swimming trunks.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Honey ...
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
Two at a time?
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
What's the point?
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Of course, back then, things were a little different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil.  We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?
Count it.
Count the fucking money, Frank.
You're their uncle.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
Bosen black.  Flat.
What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?
Because I'm your brother.  Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
Says who?
It's me.
Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
What?
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
It never was.
It's early.
I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.
She's here.
How about these?
I'll take my chances.
Yeah, fine.
Just a lucky guess.
Two years ago.  March.
Sunday.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
Good idea.
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
What?
What?
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
The party's over.
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
Yeah.
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
The tenth's out.
I'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed up.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
Sure.
No.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
Yeah?
All right.
So she's got a few sniffles.
Right.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
What's he talking about?
We're not exactly silly with time, you know.  Jack, you find anything?
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Give me that.
Hey!
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
Wow. You ever see her again?
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Got another song for us?
Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
Thanks, Lloyd.
Will I see you again?
You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
Come on, Ed.
Downstairs.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
Aren't the kids asleep?
It's okay.  Last one.
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
Nothing.
You're upset.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
How come you didn't close your eyes?
Must've been a cheap date.
So, what happened?
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
Frank wasn't 'there.
Look, if you want to leave...
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
Hi.
Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over. Like a song.
Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
Another five years, huh?
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
Why not?
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
Huh? Oh, no.
I'm not much for sweets.
You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
You mean if I get sick?
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
For being one helluva guy.
-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
What more proof do you need?
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
Jon, what is it?
That's what they always say.
Damn right.
You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex?
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
You mean like ... condoms?
You can't blame me for trying.
There's fun, bro.  Then there's FUN.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
Jon, you're starting to remind me -- of me.  Congratulations.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games.  There're leftovers in the fridge.
No.
You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law.  Remember what my brother called you?
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
Oh, that Karl.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
So you left her?  Just like that?
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? They’re all panicked here...
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
I’m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
I don’t think you’re hearing me.
I’m not worried, Mom. He’s still learning our ways...
Trouble at work?
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god’s sake!
She said that?
Pretty much.
Look, maybe I’m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtation’s harmless but you’re playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
I never won anything in bowling.
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You’re doing well...
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
I’ve got all the time in the world...
You just said everyone needs something.
I've got everything I need.
It’s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
You mean because you thought I was cocky I’m now on a permanent acid trip?!!
Please.  Just tell me what’s happening to me. In plain English.  None of that mumbo jumbo...
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
C’mon, as soon as I put them down, you’re gonna grab a couple...you always do...
You want me to handle him?  I think I’m ready...
We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
I was in the city.
Uh huh...
HEY!
And...?
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Why’d we ever leave?
I want it...
And now...?
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
Way out...
It’s like a museum.
Think bigger.
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
Promise me again...
I promise. Come to bed, honey.
Jack...God, it’s been so long...You look...
I’m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It’s a box marked “Jack.”  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
To Paris. Paris, France.
It’s because I’m shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
But you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
That’s easy. You’ve seen my car.
Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. You’re a scotch man, single malt, not because it’s trendy but because you’ve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
I had it at four.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
Am <u>I</u> okay?!  You wanna explain that?!
O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
Got it, teach.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Baby, you're scaring me.
Where do you <u>think</u>?  With <u>Sue</u>.
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
They're not costumes.
Right, whatever, have fun.
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
Last one down springs for room service.
Okay, "mom."
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
<u>Ben</u> did this?
Yes, thanks.
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are.
Of course I was.  I'd read all your papers on bioethics.  Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Victor, are you feeling alright?
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
No...
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
As part of the Crew.
He's blanked out on that one particular point.
Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
We're pushing oxygen today.
But I did. I'm positive!
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
I've done all I could with the laser.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
It's too late!
If there's any chance --
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
Remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus.
Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
The Wall's transparent...
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Can I see your license and registration please?
...What're you talking about?
What?
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
Yeah.
We split that.
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.
Yah, you don't need that. Now were you thinking of financing here?  You oughta be aware a this GMAC plan they have now, it's really super -
Oh, he's adorable.
Officer Olson.
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
No, I gotta - hey, Norm, I thought you were goin' fishin' up at Mile Lacs?
Uh-huh.
And what about the other fella?
Ya kiddin'!
Ma'am, I answered your question.
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
No, no, fax is -
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
It's okay, Scotty.
Yah.
Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha!
Yah.
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
...There's a million dollars here!
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Call 'em up.
No way.
Yah...
No, that's okay.
Yah - how are you doon?
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
Huh? Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
Yah, is this Marge?
Yah?
No.
Not on your feet too much?
Yah.
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
We're still men.
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
I'll ask the questions, son.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
What?
Please.  Can't we do something... ?
So far, you have four and I only have two!
I suppose.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
It suits you.
Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
Here.
Do you care?
Hear what?
Have we been talking too long?  Must we change the subject?
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
Is that what you're calling it?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
Whatever.  I'll take my food to go...
I'm sorry, but I...
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
...And you open the door and you step inside.  We're inside our hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light.  That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light.
What do you want me to do?
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
I don't... think so.
Don't I?
A hotel?
Would that be a problem?
Can I stay at your place?
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
This is crazy.
But a good strange.
The fight.
This fight, pussy.
What?
Show-off.
Alive or dead?
Shatner.  William Shatner.
He was obviously able to handle it.
No.  Not at all.
This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll mix it back in when we make the soap.
We don't... ?
Okay, and... and...
Tell him!
Imagine how he feels.
What are you doing?!
... is over.
"Applicant?"
And, sometimes you control it...
Um, well... technically, no.
You want out?
What?
Defuse the bomb, please.
Defuse the bomb?
You need me.
I swear on my life, I won't...
Appreciate something.
What?
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
Did you hear what I just said?!
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
No, please, no, God, no!
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Nice work.  Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me.  But I doubt you'll survive that long.
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
Taken care of.
Yeah, you should have specified.
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
Clean up?  I don't...
I wasn't worried about us.
Impossible.  She was on the onramp.
I can live with thaaaa --
For Christ sakes girl, take a breath.
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
I know, we'll be there soon.
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
Then, let's go see him!
Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
In Death...
That's right, buddy.
What's that?
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
Read you.
Powerful warrior.
American?
Alright.  Home run.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
Nothing we can do, man.
Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand.
Why's that?
Why'd they want us?
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
I do?
I couldn't get you in.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
We like you.  At least the computer at Langley likes you.  Pulled your file because of various factors.  Service record. Area familiarity.
That's right.
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
What?
The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
It's not necessary.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
Don't dance me, Kirkhill.  You'll be walking funny.
Word came down... they wanted an answer.  And they knew the answer they wanted: no POWs.  But it had to look good.  Best effort.  The whole dog-and-pony show.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Mind if I sit down?
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
Fine.
Really?
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
Jack, he's starting a conversation...
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Okay.  ... I love you...
What does that mean?
See, I told you!
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
But..How could that happen?
Well, it's not unusual in his case... Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. Are you relatives?  Well, it doesn't matter. We'll take care of it. He'll have to be sent back to the same institution.. 
He and his wife was were at some bar ..and some nut came in with a shotgun and blew the place apart. She was a beautiful girl...She never knew what hit her.
Come on now...You can't sit here.
Yes... I... I agree...
Good.  You believe this drunk?
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
The Little People?
I'm the one what?
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
I know...
Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
Can I take you to lunch?
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
The Red Knight!
Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
I know!
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
OWW...MAN...
You don't have to say that.
What are we about to do?
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
A wig?
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
You said.
You're playing the other side.
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
Yeah, great.  Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
"You'll be burned out/Or smoked out/An' come back to me, I know..."
Well, is that a happy face I see?
Just finish eating.
Who?
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
Well, you seem very professional...
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
What?
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
I don't know where she is!
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
But what about me?
Tomorrow, then.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
Of course I'd like to.
Yes, it is!
Just give me a chance, will you?
Yes.
No, the last time was three years ago.
What?
Nothing. Will you excuse us for a while?
All right, let's have a rematch.
Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
Well, I should hope not...
Steam.
I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
Oh, for pity's sake...
Aaron, how you doin'?
What?
What?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
Me? No. Don't want none either. Such bastards, man.
I kissed those girls.
I won't let my motha cut my hair.
Pitt.
Man, if I go down you're goin' down with me.
Positive.
Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
Nothing.
Jus' from around the way.
Nah.
You're lucky.
Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
Yes.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
That's Babar.
Two bs?
That's two.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Just relax....
There is?
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
Thought so. What for?
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
Where am I?
Can I get you something?
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
You may be right.
Till then.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
Well, I'm fully covered.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Velma.
Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around.  Don't go back in there.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
They busted me last week.
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
Yeah. Maybe.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
I want you to murder me.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
I have the same problem with my help.
Take it where?
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Nothing to it.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
I have this effect on lots of women.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
Yes.
It's amazing.
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
No.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
Cabana one.
One.
I would, actually.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Muchas gracias.
This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
I never read the paper.
I don't know.  Look!
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
Print this Frank.
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
Forget it.
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
I ain't -- got -- you.
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Nuthin'.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
I'll do my best.
All your friends call you Jazz.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
I like.
Who?
You're not funny.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Wha --
Three hundred.
Why are all these people after me?
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Ye-ah.
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
'Booty Time.'
Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
Anyway you want it, asshole.
Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Go on, another time, another place.
Golly, I'd probably faint.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
What about Don?
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Fuck me...
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Only on a first name basis.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
Friendship's a lot different out here.  A wrong number is a relationship.  But then this isn't a social call.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
No - no.
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
No... yeah...
Did they follow you?
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
Sois gentil avec lui.  On ne sait jamais.  Il peut te faire travailler à la télévision.
He is not wrong.
You want some eggs.
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
When ya go back on?
The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
What about the last of the big-time spenders.  You make him?
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
For dead bodies.
I been damn careful up to now.
So what?
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Nothing.
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
They around?
The game, Graham.  The Series?
I seem nervous, huh?
I'm alright, Gibby.
He ain't the only one.
Wish you weren't.
You can talk to Julia.  Forget the radio.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Frank, this is insane...
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Next time lets put some money on it.
What?
Fed up?  Lemme tell you something, in a 1000 years, when school kids study America, they're gonna learn about three things: the Constitution, Rock 'n' Roll, and Baseball.
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
Hello?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
It's Mom.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
In my pocket.
What's wrong?
Go in where?
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
Yeah.  That's it.
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
Look who's talking.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Where are you going?
Drop me off?  How do you mean?
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
I know how to do it.  I mean, how do we do it in the hammock?
I'll think of something.
Sure.
Yes, man!
Be a man, man.
Have you ever made love in a hammock?
Is that so bad?
I don't know.
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
You promised you'd never ask me.
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
I just want you to like me.
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
My ass.
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
It's just beginning.
Shhh...You know what I used to do when I was a little girl when I got scared?
Boy scouting.
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
He didn't say anything?
I've seen it.
Jason Voorhees is dead.
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
You need to leave.
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Okay.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
Next, you dial a number.
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
Are you crazy?!
I mean really never.
I'm literally going to kill you!
A pizza?!
He bought you that?
My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit.  He might even pay some attention to me.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
Time to check out the waiters.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
No.
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
Hi, Sean.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
Just radio for help, okay???
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
What did you find?
I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel.
We must abandon.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
It's just a review.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
Don't wait Efor me.
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
What?
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
What do you mean?
Had to be him.
Let's work on it.
Does what feel comfortable?
She died.
What?
The Red Sox
It can't be all that personal.
We're able to surprise each other.
He will absolutely hate it.
Opening night?
First you tell me.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
And you've been extremely patient.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
This could be it!
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
Get yourself something to eat.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
My back is killing me.
It's the kid's lucky day.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
They're my team.
You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
You're not making sense.
Burnt sienna.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
One more time.
I don't know.
Where are you going now?
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Yes -- I can't talk like this.
Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
I'm sorry.
Going nearer to God!
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
He said he's in charge...
I've never spoken for anything else.
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
Hm.  Is it?
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
I --
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
That was England.
I dined at the prison.
Ahh.
Somehow I expected not.
Very well.
I congratulate them.
Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
I don't know! Nehru, Patel, almost every Congress Official is in jail... and their wives and their children -- we've even arrested Nehru's mother.
If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
It's over.
Who are you trying to convince?
I'll take care of it.
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
Surely you know what you have.
Thank you, no.
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?
--I walked right in front of it.  I was never more sober in my life.
They think I offed the Director.
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
Again?
In case you get back before I do.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
I hope he's not just a body.
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
You celebrate, Jerome?
Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.
What exactly is wrong?
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
Only every time I'm in here.
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--
My license expired, let's get out of here.
Sure...
It looks fine.
Where do you want to go?
Better than old times.
No. It's been a long time.
It's just been a while.
Sure.
Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
I see it...
There are three men dead.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
You bastard...
I'll bet you can.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
When are you going to learn?
I did I killed a man.
El Paso.
Listen to me. It's hard enough.
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
Just get your clothes on...
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.
Oh my God.
All right. Shells?
Where?
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Suit yourself.
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Just sandwiches...
Can't leave the desk.
And I keep my mouth shut?
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
Go with God.
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
Who?
Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest.
What did you do?  Albert?
Oh ay?
What about?
You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself.
Yes.
I've been asked to make sure you don't.
Brumby!
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
I can't.
Yes.
Once a week?
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
It's the truth.
I don't know nothing.
Do you?
Could you do me a favour?
Could you please put my glass on the table?
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
Thanks for coming.
Yes.
Wilton Estate.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
Since when did he drink whisky?
Yes.
Right.
Today? At the races. He always goes.
How many?
Who's Brumby?
You're a bastard.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
Piss off, Ray.
What for? Protective purposes?
Knock it off, Gerald.
That's right, Harry.
Ha.
That's six hundred pounds, Harry. Two hundred to follow you, and I've raised it four hundred.
...Polacks...
I had to.
You ever get 'em?
And now...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
...this shit...
Eh?
I...
It's not right.
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
Himself?
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
No, we're just...
Talking about it as a...
No.  Not actually.
Have I said that?
He'd give me a job.
I...
What will they know?  That I stole the leads?  I didn't steal the leads, I'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then I'm going to the Como Inn.  Why did I go to Graff?  I got a better deal. Period.  Let 'em prove something. They can't prove anything that's not the case.
What if you don't get caught?
Me?
Absolutely.
In the abstract...
Do you need five grand?
Huh?
It's a waste of time.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
They stole the phones.  They stole the leads.  They're...Christ.  What am I going to do this month? Oh, shit... 
...what am I going to do all month...
A waste of time?  Why?
Yes.  The cops.  No.
They aren't?
Where were you?
At home.
Yes.
Would you excuse us, please...?
Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
Moss...Who told him?
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
The people downtown said...
You're done, come down, and let's...
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
...then...
Not lately it isn't.
...after the thirtieth...
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
Twenty percent.
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
Is that it?  Is that it?  You want to do business that way...?
Why I don't...
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
Excuse me...
What?
What are you talking about?
Who kept the other half?
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Call up the bank.  I called them.
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
"You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
Fuck her...
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
No, Mr. Roma.  I don't need the time, I've made a lot of investments in the last...
My wife told me to look into...
The monthly interview...?
Oh!  For the magazine...
Go ahead.
I'm sorry...?
Me.
Lingk.  James Lingk.
It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
Three days.
Of course you have three days.
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
What was yesterday?
Tell me again.
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
What power?
What, "this"?
Forget the deal, Jimmy.  Forget the deal...you know me.  The deal's dead.  Am I talking about the deal?  That's over.  Please. Let's talk about you.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on, Jim.  I want to tell you something.  Your life is your own.  You have a contract with your wife.  You have certain things you do jointly, you have a bond there...and there are other things.  Those things are yours.  You needn't feel ashamed, you needn't feel that you're being untrue...or that she would abandon you if she knew.  This is your life.  Yes.  Now I want to talk to you because you're obviously upset and that concerns me.  Now let's go. Right now.
You hear what I said?
You did that?
Why not?
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
You closed him yesterday.
Okay, okay, okay, gimme this shit. Fine. 
Your contract went out to the bank.
No, where is it?
I can't.
I can help you.
Some day you will.
Well, that's alright... alright. Good.  You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right?  You know... I never finished college.  I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
No.  He would give it away.  I know how to repay a consideration.
Go on, answer him when he talks to you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi.
I saw him with you.
You're not my father!
I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother?
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
Ah, you're a sharp young fellow. How is it I've never noticed you before  You're too quiet for your own interest.  I could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable.  No hard feelings, eh?  If I can ever do you a service let me know. You've done a good job for yourself tonight.
It was hard to have him killed.
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
I can feel it in the way he talks to me.
She's gone, Tom.
No, I have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and Tom, you are my brother.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
It was a boy.
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
Tom, what do I do now?
Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
I'm going to the market.
Whose orders are these?
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
Goodbye, Michael.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
You haven't heard me.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike, I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he manages the casino for us.
I do not.
He did business...but he never trusted him.
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
I want you to settle on their terms.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat.  Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent.
Just thinking out loud.
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
Yes.  I trust you.
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
What did she mean by going flooey?
Broke is more like it.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
But it's just my face you want to draw.
Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable...  Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.
What?
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
What way might that be?
But we have to match the other sketch.
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
You're the one who started it.
If that's okay?
No.  The girl.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
You survived it.  It can't hurt you now.  It's no good to dig it up.
What'd you say?
What won't do?
For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking.
Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
Fuck off!
She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin.  Dogs are so much more dependable than men.
Oh dear.
Luminal.
Of course.  This afternoon.
Of course.  I attended Eton -- it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught.  I was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it.  The Great War, you know.  You had a Good War, but we had a great one.
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
Quite.
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
A boost. A big boost ...
Are you crazy? You throw down with The Carpenter? You got a grudge against your life?
I don't want him hurt...
I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ...
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
Castlebeck.
Keys were in it ...
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
What color?
He's in some trouble ...
Tuesdays ...
Yes, sir -
"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
Don't go there, Toby --
Yeah ...
Yeah -
I heard you were pumping gas -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
Yeah --
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
What era was that -- ?
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
Toby...
Hospital.
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
So I was replaced by Mitch?
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
Kip's in trouble
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
No ...
Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
Oh, God...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
No worries ...
How is he -- ?
Is he still working here ?
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ...
What happened to Sway?
I'll see you soon --
How come ... ?
Come on. Kip, talk to the guy
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
Wha?  Me?
Why would I get into that?
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
Nods again.
Anybody!  You understand?
What are you gonna do?
Jezuz Christ!
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Where's the stuff?
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
Yeah.
Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick.
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
Tommy  ...
So do I.
I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
I don't want them left back.
Watch what happens.
No one. I didn't have the number.
Why not?
She went to Medical school in California.
Why didn't you yoke him?
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
I told you "no" yesterday!
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
And what do you see?
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
Building two.
Okay. How?
It's an integer proof.
Bullshit.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
It's Saturday.
Find out what?
The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
Why me?
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Well, you're the only one.
Maybe he doesn't care about that.
Now wait a minute--
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
Never been.
I got one of those too.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
About thirty million to one.
Who is he?
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
Like what, Will?
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
This is a real piece of shit.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
No.
So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
My wife's dead.
Hence, the word remarried.
My wife's dead.
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
When did you know she was the one?
"I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
I guess.
What did you think?
I didn't ask for this.
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
Look at me. What do you want to do?
Yes.
I know.
It's not your fault.
Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
Only if you grab my ass.
Good luck.
Okay...
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Bullshit.
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
No.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
Okay. Go on.
Sure, but what is this?
Joad.
How many men?
Two.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Have a little snort?
What you figger to do?
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
Want to work, do you?
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
Yeah.
That's where I get off.
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
Maybe that's jus' what he done.
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
When?
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
He was a good man.
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
They gone.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed.
What's this?
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yeah...
What do you do?
--No.
Don't say that.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Fine, Bob. How are you?
It's nice to see you again.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Okay... Hold on...
Like love?
Could be. The physical substance of love.
Other people can't.
I just know.
We're both professionals, Oatman.
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
Up on the right.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Nice talk, Sugarmouth.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
Okay.
If he does our job, he's our job.
No...
That's going to cost.
And they want me to make up for it.
In Detroit. This weekend.
You haven't looked at the dossier.
Will do.
Thank you.
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
I'm a professional killer.
You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am I right? So here's the deal. I'm not sure I can do anything, but I'm prepared to give it a go --  -- if you'll help.  You have a problem with that?
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
Thanks.
Feel good?
OK.
How did you find out all that?
Just make yourself comfortable.
Why?
Doesn't matter.
What about him?
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Yeah?
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
What?
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
Don't they believe in signs here?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
Well, one was for salad...
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Grace, I don't hate your father.
I said... I started.
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you?
Hi.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
The funeral's on Friday.
Okay.
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
Why?!
Night.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Well, of course, right...
I understand, but Annie, please...
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
Maybe... look -- just...
The number's by the phone.
How long were you married?
What do you mean?
Now that's cool.
You think it's cool?
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Curtis.
What are you doing?
Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.
What did we learn in school today?
Revenge.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
It nibbles. You see this?
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
Yeah?
Yeah. RISC is good.
If I win, you become my slave.
And you have to smile.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
Okay, thank you.
I know, I know who wrote it.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
Red handed! You won't be having any more trouble from them.
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
What? whatwhatwhat?
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
Virus?
Pervert! What are you talking about?
Real charmer.
I'll take you down there.
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
When did you find this out?
This morning.
No, you don't understand.
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
Go!
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
Okay, out.
Do you love me Rachel?
Yeah, hurry up.
No.
You won't look pushy.
Where are you going?
The state police won't know how to stop him.
No problem, Sheriff.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
Its true, Sheriff.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
He's been here.
They didn't know what they were fighting.
It isn't a man.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Car trouble?
Don't touch him Jamie!
You blame everything on kids.
He shouts, too.
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
I've already lost it.
Sure, see you later.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
Is that all you say?
Yeah.
Will you call me tomorrow?
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
You have the wrong feeling.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
They could be.
There was no one outside.
What did he look like?
Promise?
That's the idea. Here we are.
Are there any special instructions?
What does that mean?
Mm-mm!
Oh.
Are you really interested?
Great.
Look at this.
A lot of works.
It feels like you're in France.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
What?
No, he called late last night.
But I'm seeing him.
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Hmm?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
I cry at the opera.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Yes, but you name names.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Oh, Elliot!
What are you doing here?
Oh, what, in this section of town?
You're out looking here?
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Yeah, sure. 
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
No!  No...
No, I don't think so.
Oh.
What are you doing?!
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
Is something wrong?
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
Was I?
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
No!
Are you in love with someone else?
Yeah.
I am glad to see you.
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
No, nothing.
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
Mm-hm.
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Why?
I'm sorry.
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
No.
I went into a store, I bought a rifle.  I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself.  The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Oh, me, I'm okay.
I know...I know.
I think so.
Well, what about artificial insemination?
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
So what's new?
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
What's the matter?
Oh, so loosely.
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
You're grateful, but you resent me.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!
You want some?
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Yeah?
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
...namely a personality.
No, you can tell me.
No, I am.  I am.
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Oh!
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
Yeah.
Just a few minutes ago.
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that  it's ironic.  I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought  that I could love anybody else.  And here it is, years later and I'm married to you  and completely in love with you.  The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  It really is.  I...  It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister...  doesn't work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  It's, you know, it's a...
Mmm, what?
Where are the antihistamines?
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating. 
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
And?
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
Or, perhaps...
...how are things at the Hospital?
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
Why me?
I'm not.
...the whole world's out to get you...
How <u>crazy</u> is that....
That's right.
I know her by the Back.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
...are they hard to get?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why? Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS. IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As Lechter will return back.  You see?  To the sight of his oppressor <u>wounded</u>. He will return to savage our beloved Miss Starling.  Bring me a drink.
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
I like Popcorn...
...they're from Baltimore....
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
I am all attention.
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
How so?
I have had the honor. 
You know America?
Yes.... yes...
Sir, with all due respect....
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
...might I make a suggestion...?
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
What else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
You goin to shoot yourself? 
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
....because we don't have any mmm...
Yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as I've said...
And why should we believe you?
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
What shape is the scar?
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
Or clear your windshield with it.
...but:  this particular statue...
....that's right.
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
...yes...?
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
<u>Someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. 
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
They wouldn't be a bit surprised..
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
Ooh, I'll think of something, missy. A telescope?  Where you going?  I don't want to know.
Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...
Why do you even like me?
Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.
I don't know about you dickweeds, but I gotta go take a nice, long juicy dump.
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
How do you mean?                                            ]
That's not what I was worried about.
That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.
It's so great to be able to talk to a girl and not have to ask "What's your major?" I hate that.
All right.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
Geez, don't listen to them.
Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games.
What do you want from me?
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
Please Veronica. Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight, I'll never forget it.
Suicide is a private thing.
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
I don't really like your friends either.
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die.
Killing her won't solve anything.
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
And your worst enemy.
Like a suicide thing?
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
Did to.
May<u>be</u>.
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
No-o!
You know what I want, babe?
I thought I...you..
Answer him dick!
I guess.
May<u>be</u>. There's kind of a dark horse now in the running.
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
sighs.
I'm educating myself!
Open this door!
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
Love, you can still write to each other.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
hurries over.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
Him . . .
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
Your wife...?
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Your insight is enlightening.
No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Second most common?
Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...
Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
Ambrose. I know.
I said she's been missing for-
Zero's a number right?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
Who the hell are you talking to?
Two.
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
You can trust me. Your wife is dead and you need to move past that. And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it, not around it. Surrender yourself to your wife's death. Let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side. It's the only way you can become whole again.
I'm beginning to... be aware of that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna do nothing heroic here, you can trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya say we just sit down for a while. I don't have no tricks, I'm not that smart.  You could, like, rest up for the jump.
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
Bail, for Chrissake!  I'm innocent!
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're not... heroic.  It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined.  What about it?
Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
You're a celebrity, John.  People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
This guy LaPlante won an award?
If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
She's talking to him now.
Helluva story!
For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
Reporters don't have hormones?
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
How are they with kids?
I'm Bernard, by the way.  Those are cool Reeboks, Neil.  They're real new, aren't they?
Where are these toys of yours?
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
No, no, no, no.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
I should.
Right.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
Aw, okay.
Why are you mad at each other?
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
He'll never appreciate it more.
But there's this <u>psycho</u>.  Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with <u>every day</u>.  I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
What's that?
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
Damn.
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
"Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going."
Just reduced.
Two -- three if you count the husband.
Do you have enough money?
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
Oh really?  <u>You've</u> been going through a lot of personal crap. You, Princess Di and Madonna?
And I can't help having a cold.
Get on the other side of that.
Right over here.
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
Promise.
Talk to me about what?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
Caution shows wisdom.
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
What else?  What else do you hear right now?
That's all?
Yes.
Maybe myself.
For what?
Me?  Of course.
You always get to go first.
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
How?
What are you hoping to find inside?
I know.
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Is it?
Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't?  What if they were trying to get out?
Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
And this?
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
Is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they're in trouble?
Fine.
If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
I think he's dead!
The mother is in Florida visiting her sister.  The father works at home, so he's probably inside.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
I guess not.
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
You won't die if you let me help.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
Like what?
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
I gotta piss real bad.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
We're trapped in a house.
Dennis.
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
Yeah.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
How can we get out?
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
He.  Can't.  Answer.
Go, Chief.
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Are all of you named Jones?
Special Agent Jones.
I thought they locked you in your room.
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
How do I reach him?
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
I'll be back.
And four children?
Get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  Paul will look after you.
What's happening?
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
And what will they do with these satellites?
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
You said you had no whiskey.
After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
Why not? We are half way there already.
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Why sir?
You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.
Call, sir?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
I need a great favor.
I will give you my house.
Move? Where to?
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
They do not have your connections.
Jean Baptiste!
Murdered! By whom?
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Get in.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
A kiss.
We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump.
What's wrong?
How dead?
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
The staff, the guests.
The staff and guests! How many?
Where?
Can I help you?
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Problem? No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know, things to see, people to do?
If you don't calm the hell down I'm gonna strap you in for electro-shock!
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
Best of a nightmare.
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
Don't push it.
It'll have to do.
What --
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
You're hurting me.
Really? Well, let it rip.
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
I think it's something better experienced then described.
-- my loss --
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
Fascinated.
Please! I need your help.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years.
Believe me, we need to.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years...  ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I....
Excuse me?
How, he's supposed to be dead!
Melissa...?
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
-- something horrible...I don't understand --
Yes.  It was.
The knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.
Sure.  Did you see the others?
He's blessing the house.
For good luck honey.
Daddy help!
Must be...
I just, I don't know...
It's not going to work.  I'm too smart for you.
I'm being realistic.  Look, I have a spiritual side.  I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house.  That should count for something.
Are you ok?
What?
Not going!  Are you out of your mind?!  Wait!
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
Did you know her very well?
Aubrey?  It's mommy.
Perhaps I'll see you in church.
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
Yes, they are.
We'll be there.
Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?
So where is it?
Sorry.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
Thank you.
You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
But how in God's name ...
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
Yeah, I mean, come on, going through the Iron Curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire, it's supposed to be strangling a guard...
"But we'll be the same as we started...
You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there...
Last rites, sister?
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
Oh.  No.
What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?
Oh.  Well, what's this?
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?
I guess that's a no.
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
Remember that shoe you lost...
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
You wouldn't risk the dime to call the police.  You have no proof.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
Employer?  The president?
God, I miss communism.  The Red Threat.  People were scared, the Agency was respected, and I got laid every night.
Yeah, right.  By the way, as long as I'm getting things off my chest, I'm the one who killed your little monkey.  Made it look like a Mafia hit.  Did it for fun. Ciao.
With a little jazz.
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
Yeah.
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
Why yes, do you know it?
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
-- these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely, et cetera.
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
Tell me about it.
For instance, take a look at this sweet baby...
Forty-eight years...
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
This you're familia' with.
...Geez.
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yes sir...
I --
Wait a minute!
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
You're fired.
But, sir! --
Sir, my leg is on fire!
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
He don't look wise.
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
Looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- I don't know whether I'll be able to get away with it.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
Her son drowned.  She brooded until her mind was affected. All the Houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology.
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
I like her already.
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
We're half-brothers.  Paul is mother's first child.  When his father died, she married my father. Dr. Rand, the missionary.  And you know what they say about missionaries' children.
Well -- and things -- might be a better description of what you'll find.  I'd better come along and show you the town.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Wait. I want to listen.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
Wesley can be very entertaining.
You didn't drive her mad.
Didn't I?  I don't know.  That's the simple truth of it.  I don't know.
What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
I guess I'll wait until I'm home, Mrs. Rand.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
You were possessed.  That is true -- possessed by your subconscious mind.  You were in the Houmfort, surrounded by their symbols.  To them, nothing worse can happen to a person than to be made into a Zombie.  Your subconscious mind used their own words for evil.
You admit that it is terribly dangerous. Why do you advise it?
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
So early?
I do. I'm -- are you...?
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
Stuffed and baking.
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...
Thanks.
Ben--
Good night kiddo.
What do you think we're doing, dad?
Huh?
Yeah.
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
That I will indeed.
See ya.
What do you mean?
Howdy there. You, young knight. Can you check on the mead? Can you sally forth and secure us some more mead?
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
And I have a feeling for you too, because you're just like -- I feel for you like you're -- you're just like --
Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
Yeah?
I don't know.
It's a one-on-one kind of date thing.
Charles, what time is it?
Is this Charles?
Yeah.
Just thought I'd stop by.
Yeah.
Are you his girlfriend?
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
Okay.
That's all, for now.
Four unwarranted shootings, witness intimidation, and cocaine theft.
Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
Actually...
We already did.
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
Twelve years younger.
Okay.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
What I saw?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
What happened at that signing?
She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle of the night.  Bruises all over her back, her upper arms.  I pled with her to let me call the police, but she wouldn't hear it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that.
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
That's what I said.
Who was Kay seeing besides Randy Stetz?
Did you have sex with her?
Yes.
Congratulations.
Kay told me.  She comes to me, you know. Tells me things.  About you.  About me.
Then so was mine...
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
This an accident, Walter?
You're not following procedure.
Your lips, they didn't move.
Surely you know the one who made you...
But why?
We want no quarrel with him.
Yes... My God...
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
Is that supposed to frighten me?
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
What have you done?
And you never cried -
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
And no one knows but us...
Be still!
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
And if I don't?
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
You finish her - if you feel so much -
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
What are you saying?
Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our little daughter?
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
Yes.
How could I not? She had to know.
He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
You need a new passion, Louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.
No...
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
What are you doing in my closet?
Yeah, right -- whatever.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
Yes.
Yes.
Just kidding.
It's too late for that.
What do we do?
Is he?
Yeah.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
Why?
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
No. I shot him.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
The rest of us see bathrobes.
Crowded.
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
It is my home.  My name is Hugo Albrecht.
You collect these to sell, abroad?
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
My friend -- what can one say --
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Poor Cathy --
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect ——young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Why -- no not before Thea came ——
This girl -- Thea —- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble —— the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.
He hates all my race.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
I can't do that. These families have children.
I'm hurrying.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Oh, no.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .
You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
No.
You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
I don't know how you know these things, but tell me –– where is she?
Who is it?
George Bailey.
Yes, but George . . .
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Hiya, George!
Of course it's the place.
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
I won a flower.
No charge.
A cattle boat?
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction . . . This direction?  Good night, Mrs. Bailey.
No. No.
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Okay.  What's yours?
What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
Oh . . .
Some other time, George.
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
Holy mackerel!
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
They're not my children.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
Have you notified the police?
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Okay –– what can we lose?
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?
Where's your coat and hat?
I think we're changing course a little.
Yeah.
We better go back in.
It's not going to be easy.
I was counting on hours.
Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
No big thing, we'll see who's out there, maybe picnic.
Listen to Andy, Sean.
We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?
I need a hand here....
Till noon.  This is on my own time.  Hi, Shorty.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Positive I.D.?
Oh.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
No backtalk!  I spoke to Upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there.  You can work until school starts.
Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
In the den.
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
Nothing.
Terrific.
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
Do you?
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
That's great.
That you were fired.
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Just one minute....
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
I know, I know....
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Two of them are still missing!
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
That's you.
Now I really want to see it.
You going to fool around with Mike?  Well, I'm not doing anything with him.
I'm not crazy about blind dates.
I know.
3:30.
I can't stop thinking!
Sideways -  For every yard we go this way, we also slide sideways this way....
Nope.
Give me back my hat!
Oh, great.
Is there something I don't know about?
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
What about me?
Not tonight.
Quiet!  Shhh!
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
And Philip will be there to film it.  Now that's the end of it!
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
Shit.
Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
You will.  I'll see to it.
Don't forget you have your brother.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
That's a lot of ground to cover.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
Bracelets.
Yes?
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
Sounds wonderful.
It's my new perfume.  Great White, the Man-Eater.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
Yes.  It's faster.
Well, that's why you got it.
Hydrophobia...
Come on.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
Still sleeping.
And I like you.
And here I thought I was charming you.
Is there such a place?  A cave or something with such a flow?
I know.
Thanks.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
Take it up.
Hold still, damn it!
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
I am serious.
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
That?
Yes, there is goes.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Okay, okay... We'll get someone on it.
Sharks???
That's Dad...
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
That's what grandmas are for.
I don't want to.  I want to swing....
It sure is....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
Then don't come any closer.
I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't think there was any danger.  I'm sorry. I love you.  Both of you.
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
I'm hungry, Mom....
Adds flavor....
He heard that.
What's going on?
Mommy lets me....
I'm still five....
I didn't.
You guys must be starving....
Good.  So will I....
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
I'm not going to quit now....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
Why'd you take the boat?
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....
I don't know how....
It's wonderful....
I have my own little island.
There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....
The wind does that.  Ever been to the Bahamas before?
It needs more time to charge.
Still chasing fish?
How's Ellen?
It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
Put me down, damnit....
Where the hell's the beer...?
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
Down here....
When I invited you...
How long has he been here...?
Jake.
I'm the one who wanted to study it....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
Good night, Polly....
Yeah?
Is it your vehicle?
Since when did you drink diet soda?
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..
How'd you do it, old man?
A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
You don't really believe this?
I guess by the bed.
Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
No.
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
That's bullshit,
And did they?
Coz I'm <u>short of men</u> & Ang- elo won't do it .. Who ever I got free first - <u>you</u> <u>get</u> ..
Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
My hands?
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
No, I don't pray .. Had a dream once, about God, just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. I said, don't you listen to people's prayers?  He said, prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.
You know? How do you know?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
Why?
Yes, Sir.
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
Freddy's new obsession ..
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait- ed a good while. Said he'd go down and take a look. I hope that's O.K.
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
Okay, this is working.
Well, no you didn't --
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Could you just stop moving?
There is something missing here.
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
Absolutely.
Same to you.
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Good idea.  Thank you.
Happy. He said "happy?"
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Bye you guys. _ 88.
No no no.  I just underestimated her...  her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this?
Good night.
Easy, easy --
Fine, I just --
So I'll see you this weekend.
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
...my soul or something. _ 117.
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
Please, if I start talking --
Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
Let's do it again.
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
Why not?
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
No tell me. _ 84.
No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
No.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Go.  Flee.
It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it... you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.
Gorgeous.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
They do, my brother.
Shut up!!!
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
You hate to swim.
People change.
No, Dr. Grant says...
Nothing.
I filmed this the morning they left.
Eric!
He could have died.
How low?
DAD!
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
I don't think so.
We should take it with us to signal any planes.
KEEP GOING!
I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
Are you sure?
I want to be an astronaut.
Something must've scared them.
Back out! Move!
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.
I want to see the nesting ground!
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
My vacation is over in a week.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
How close do you have to be?
Good.
Possible.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
Piss.
She's nuts.
Our chance to do what?
I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
No way.
Where's Kelly?
Look!  Sarah!
Why should they?
Because it exists.
I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
Are you insane?!
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
I'm trying!
None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
Damn!
What now?
The monitors are failing.
Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Shhhhh!
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order.
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
The what?
They were wrong.  Case closed.  This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake!
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
It's my favorite.
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
Stick to my heels.
The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
Why not?
I get ah - -
Alan, listen to this.
Unpredictability....
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Please - - chance it.
- - shut up.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
Why not?
People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
Not without massive sequence gaps!
to Ellie) You will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?
Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
You want to talk about this?
What?  What can we do?
For today, I guarantee it.
Who?
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
Let's get you out.
Alright.
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
Sure.
Excellent.
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
Great.
Who is this? What's going on?
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair.  If we're going to argue insanity, we're going to need something a little more concrete.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
So?
I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.
Cute waitresses?
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
Why do you work in that hideous insurance office?  -- dealing with people who fall off ladders.  Now take me -- I make my living as a stone mason.  It's not my art -- but it's the <u>tools</u> of my art.  You could be -- a journalist.
Success or nothing?
The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
Another one?
A true friend would do it.
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
When I have no reason to doubt.
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
I -- I found your jailer.
-- Listen to me --
Was he depressed?
No, I suppose not.
What makes you think so?
We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
You mean you've actually begun some?
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
Close only by virtue of antithesis.
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her.
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
I could always apply there.
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
It's ... lovely.
Miss Darrow ... I've been thinking. I would very much like to dedicate this motion picture to the memory of your father. It's a great shame he wasn't able to join us on this adventure. Truly a wonderful man.
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
No! Don't!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
And I appreciate that so much, I really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across America when they view my latest documentary sensation "Indonesia ...Hell Hole of the World". Ernie Hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. We're going out through Universal ... Laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens.
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
Native costume?
The girl's dead, Driscoll. There's no point continuing on.
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
Yeah.
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
Sorry. 
Well I have to close up now.
Yes indeed.
Why isn't he locked up?
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
I guess he figured it was better.
Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
Yes.
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
Well, let's go down and ask him.
No.
And I don't think that was Tom.
Yeah, you got to me.
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
I don't like getting splashed.
No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I --
Is that all you have to say?
How do you know how bad it was?
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
Mm.
I am.
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
What?
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
Have you discussed this with them?
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
I've just got a few --
Would I be telling you all this? She copped out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
Nobody's seen that.
Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.
I see you have people there. What are their names?
Sure.  Didn't I ever tell you French toast was my specialty? I'll bet I never told you that. Now then, the first thing we need is...  ... eggs!  Right?
That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
You got a letter from mom.
Mom, I mean dad?
That's okay.
Then eat around it.
Yeah?
See you in the morning light.
It's my name too.
Right.
Uh, huh?
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
Where will my toys be?
Overruled.
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
And yet you chose to leave him?
Eight, almost nine years.
More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
I've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and the phone bill, so you don't have to worry about them.
What?
Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
Ted, do you love him?
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
That's my decision, Ted and that's final.
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
I don't want to hear another word against him.  Not another word.  He's a wonderful man ...a wonderful man...
I lost him?  I lost him?
Yeah.
Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
Three.  And add some basil.
Kham, Holiness.
I know.
I will buy them for you.
I will not approve it.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
Britain chooses not to.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
The people will not allow it.
Always.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
You will always!
You decide.
Ahh.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
It is possible, Holiness.
Much too young.
And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
Keystone what?
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
I coulda shot you, you--
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
Right.
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
Oh, bullshit.
They could try to tranq him on land.
Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
I'm not mushing it.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
You think?
Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
I'm fine, thank you.
And this is how he came to the boat?
Was he swallowed?
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
What is this?
I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
Look ten feet into the water.
I don't know.  Back the truck--
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
Kevin told me you were upset.
Liar?
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
Good idea.
That wasn't me.
I think we may be, yes.
Did she leave any records here? Tax or business records? Maybe a list of employees?
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Murdered...? How?
Why?
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
Are you finished?
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
What would it take?
Let's get some coffee and talk.
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
Sewing...
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
Dr. Lecter...
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
I didn't.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Why? Do you know something about him?
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.
A moth... How did you predict that?
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
No.
Did he try to?
Yes, Doctor. Please.
No! That's incidental.
What was it?
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind.
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
Yes, miss.
'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave...  Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.
No. I will find you.
You do not know what you are saying!
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
...Fort William Henry.
Ottawa!
That is sedition! Treason!
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
Your enemy...
Will you men help us stop the French?
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
Yes, sir.
Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 
Atten-hut!
Excuse me. What did you say?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Yes.
Yes.
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
My colors?
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
I'm not a doctor.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
Yeah...right...
Was there such a thing?
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
No way...
How much time does that give us?
Where's Doc?!
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
It shouldn't be a long delay.
You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
Russian.
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
Under there?
What are you going to do to him?
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
Apart from those shotguns.
Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!
They were . . .
Where did he get a hundred grand?
Jesus Christ!
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
You had better be careful.
Just carrying a bag.
All right, Dad.
All right, Kenny.
Just hold on, I got the keys.
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
He means they're thieving dogs.
Well, perhaps you can help?
Hold on. OK.  Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our interest.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
Er, well, twelve.
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
What do you mean?
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
I can fix cars.
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
That isn't true.
If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled.
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
I am, sir.
Who's "they"?
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
Do whatever they tell you--
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
And you and Private Graves--
I'm feeling okay--
September '97, that's all she wrote.
That badge--
You know the popular version of how he left town.
You got to investigate. No question about it.
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
My mother said he never asked about--
But they were Indians themselves.
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
No.
Lead mine.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
Seriously.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
We should just do it.
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
Take that pair over in the corner--
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
I thought you were married!
Tipico.
Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
That Buddy was a cool breeze.
That's a matter of interpretation--
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
You go by your old house?
Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late--
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
The Perdido thing?
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
If you spent a little more time training them--
A little older than Paloma is now.
I don't mean Fernando.
I never said that.
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
No. Is he sick?
I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
Yeah. How about that? People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up.
What do you think?
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
We haven't talked since high school.
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
More, I hope.
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
I been working on a few things.
Gotta be in person.
How 'bout you?
I didn't want to be going around your back.
You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now--
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
Why?
I love weird.
Why would I do that?
Beats me.
I told you --
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
Death.
Maybe he'll show you.
I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
Sure.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
I think so.
Good.  There.  Yes?
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
So could you walk on water?
What about Swann's miracles?
It's one in the afternoon.
Are you a gambling man?
What for?
What for?  You need to stay busy?
Yeah, I know.
Shut up!
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
Sure.  Vivovich.
No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
Help me.
And you believed him?
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
Maybe... I... don't...
Yes! Yes!
Why would I want to?
Not true.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
How long have you been married?
What do you do?
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Hi, Charlie.
I know. I don't either.
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
I know.
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
Thanks.
Oh?
Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
Is this a bad time?
Uh, no.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
It's Lydia, your wife.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Ok.
Excuse me?
You wanna come?
What?
Its bad for you.
It's ok if you are.
Are you sure you have to go?
It'll just be a few days.
Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?
It's probably trivial.
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Sushi.
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
Seemed...on edge.
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
No, I wasn't, actually.
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
Miette, come here and relax.
I didn't know what else to do...
Peter Kelson?
And also that...
What's that got to do with you?
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
What's the...OH SHIT!
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
No oxygen to the brain.
Sure.
And what's that mean?
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
He can see you Thursday.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
What happened?
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
I don't remember that.
It mattered, Mom.
What'd you do?
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
You're a caterer?
Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself...
Shh.  It's okay.
What?
I don't know sometimes.
No one's forcing her.
No.
I was just showing emotion.
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
I know.  But chances are...
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
What's that?
Just like that?
How's that been?
What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
I don't like flowers.
For how long?
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
You either.
Guess not.
I can't help girls coming up to me.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
What are we playing for?
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
Why not?
Quincy...
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
Nah.  I have curfew.
What the hell's going on?
Never had to.
Thanks.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
Funny.  I never did.
No.
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Maybe go back to school.
Find.
Better late than never, right?
One game.  One-on-one.
For what?
There's so many I just can't keep track.
What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
You hearing me?
Yup.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You work too hard, Pop.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
We need to talk.
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
Well what's the situation?
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
It's a helluva disease.
It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
Don't sit down.
I don't wanna talk to you.
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
Yeah.
That's great, thank you.
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
But I wouldn't mind comin' back in an hour just to see your pretty face!
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
Thank you.
What's that stand for?
What is it?  Did you forget something?
Yeah.
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
So you've done it --
No, no.
I lost my gun.
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
-- Richard.
Son, please, now....
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
Go. Hurry up. Let's go.
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
Finish it up without the lip.
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
Doc, go get Frank and put him on the phone.
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
Gently, son --
-- and you wanna know the common element for the entire group, like he asks...I'll tell you the answer: I'll tell you, 'cause I had that question.  I had that same question....Carbon. In pencil led, it's in the form of graphite and in coal, it's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form.  "Well...all we were asking was the common element, Donnie...but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, Kids!  Full of useless thoughts, eh?"  Thank you. Thank you.  And the book says: "We may be through with the past but the past is not through with us."  And NO IT'S NOT DANGEROUS TO DO THAT.
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
Braces?
It's...doesn't matter....
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
GIMME YOUR FUCKIN' KEYS.
Do you wanna sit down?
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
Fuckin' bullshit is right, in'it?
When was the last time you talked to your son?
-- memory?
Yeah.
Twelve.
Alright.  Thank you.
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
She lived in Tarzana.
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
Around here.
...this close...
Where does that name come from?
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
...ok...
The door was open, I got a call --
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
I'm not askin', Marcie.
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
I won't.
What happend to you?
I'm sorry.
Slowly or quickly?
It's not really pain.
--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
I'll answer anything.
Rose, I don't --
...No....
I really don't know.
But you can't say....
No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
I'II go....is it...back here?
Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
Movie Of The Week.  I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
I have to go.
Phone number.
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
Thank you.
That's pretty cool.
Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
Yes.
I hate it.
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
I understand you saved my son's life today.
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more.  But that one, it was enough.  Enough to make me love you forever.  I want you to remember that... and go on.  As strong as you are now.  No matter what happens.
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
Shut up, knave!
Tomorrow.
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
Yes, and he has a choice!
But --
Really?  If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral.
Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
Who?
The Queen Mother.  Anne.
He lures us to capture.
I heard your playing.
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
Thank you, your Majesty.
They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
I am unhurt --
What was the end page?
Shoot them!  Shoot them!
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
You would do that, your Majesty?
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
That's the point.  He slipped up, and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.
Where are you?
Alright, stay on the phone.
Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
Right behind you.
Did you start out area six?
Where do you come from, Marvosa?
And who are you?
She stole my car!!
Yeah, it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
I'll live...
Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
No.  A witness.
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
Yeah.
Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you, I promise...
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
OK...where do you want to start?
A bank?
Tubbs, these people mean business.
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Did you have sex with her?
Nahhh...
At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r.
Library of Congress.
'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.'
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
These are all dead, Will.
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
What's one way?
...I'm going to see Lecktor.
Get me a plane!
I won't be here.
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
It's not over yet.
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
It's happening again, Jack...
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
In the kitchen.
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
I don't know...
Yes...
Yes.
Absolutely,
Good.  We'll seal your promise with...
As long as it's on soft paper.  You may...  Find this curious.
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
Why do you think I called?
He's misunderstood.
That's true.
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
What's average?
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
We have it good, don't we?
At the store. You doin' some good?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Blue, then.
Blue is cold.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
Lt. Fisk said...
Yeah...
You went in the apartment?
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
Stuart is fine.
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Why should I tell you?
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
Why does it feel good?
Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them?
HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
I refuse.
Hi George!
That's alright.  Where...?
And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!
What, you don't think I can beat him?
He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  First, you piss-off women.  Then you piss-off the South.  Then you get killed!  And I did the bookings.
Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony better than you do.  Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!
Yeah...
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
DON'T TOUCH ME!
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!
Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
You don't, do you?
Hear what?
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
I need an exit!  Fast!
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
How do you know all this?
I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
Do you want to know what it is?
When?
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door.  You're the one that has to step through.  Tank, load the jump program.
Your mind makes it real.
Yeah.
What's going on?
She would say she knows enough.
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
What did she tell you?
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
Morpheus, I don't know --
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
I need the main wet-wall.
I know.  Poor Morpheus.  Without him we are lost.  We will never find the One.
You're going to have to make a final choice.  In one hand, you will have Morpheus' life.  In the other hand, you will have your own.  One of you is going to die.  Which one, will be up to you.
Of what?
What did she tell you?
We can't leave him!
Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
The Oracle.
Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix.  They are used only in emergencies.  If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  It would be the end of everything.
Guns.  Lots of guns.
Duck!
Look who's talking.  Pretentious bullshit.  Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh?
'Thou art then a king?'
So?
Not quite...but keep trying.
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Ok, how's everything going?
What pipes?
That bad, huh?
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
We'll settle it tonight.
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
"Francis Macomber."
That's the word...preoccupied.
Sal!... fourteen street.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
You mean it's heisted.
Friends of yours Michael.
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
Yes, it is.
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
I thought you were buying my company.
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
Drew, you're out of line.
You're taking this too far, Drew.
"Death and Taxes"?
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
What'd it say?
Maybe, who knows?  You know how voices are.  Let's go.
Is there any more to it?
What do you mean?
I get the feeling you've done some business before.
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
Thanks, Quince.
But I didn't mean to do it!
The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
I from dat nex' place.
Make it time.
Mine, too.
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Hey, this is fun.
Thanks.
Oh yes, I do.
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
I've got plenty of friends.
I don't know.
I adore things like that....food I can't do without.  Don't you?
-- I guess you haven't.
And is your heart beating strangely?
Faster.  And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
Will it?
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
No.
How long have I got?
So can I.
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
Uh-huh.
Absolutely.
About Susan?
This universe?
I told you, 'watch it'.
Yes?
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
What are you saying, that it's time to go?
Not at all.
Does she know where she's going?
Yes.
'...Yes --'
Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
'Take me'...?  Where?
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
How's that, Quince?
No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
See.  There.  What'd I tell you?
We're all ears.
Drew told me.
I hope so.
You're only six-five once.
You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
Yer damn right.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
It's something.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
Damn right.  Looking for her right now.  Who knows?  You might be her.
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
You never know.  Lightning could strike.
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
What can I do for you, Leonard?
Burt.
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
Couple days.
He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?
No, let's go.
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
I don't want your fucking money!
Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear.
Yeah. You?
Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
Who did he go to meet?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Somebody's come. Already.
Calls himself Dodd.
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
About your whore of a wife?
Can I ask you something?
What do you want?
Oh. But haven't we met before?
Are you Teddy?
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
Teddy!
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
She's involved with these drug dealers.
What sort of questions?
I have money.
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
Why not?
How do you know him?
Wouldn't be appropriate.						*
No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
Why would I do that?						    *
Why would I have a gun?
Lemon or lime?
Recruit us to do what?
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
How many?
Really?  So, what is this, a party?
And what is that?
Havana.
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
I insist.
Exactly.
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
Zero risk.
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
I'll be on board by noon.
What'd Neptune tell you?
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Stevens?
Something's wrong.
Nothing.
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
Good.  So let's go...
Verdado.
I would never doubt you.
What's the point?  It's going down.
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
You set this up!
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
Alonzo...
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
You sure are a pretty lady.
No, ma'am, I'm not.
What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
Okay. Never argue with a man.
I show you what problem --
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
Who?
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
I'm wet.
Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?
You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there.
Get down -- where?
You got it.
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Hamidou.  Chief of the Guards. Don't fuck with him. He almost killed an Italian dude couple months ago.  Bad news. He try anything with you?
Twenty months?
Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Oh Jesus! 
Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are
But just...
Just what?
Twelve years.
Billy!  Please!
What?
Cut his fucking throat.
Whose?
I know where it is.
You're ayip!
Learn what?
You 'Merican.  You don't know.
I know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge,  I arrange everything - just right.  And I think we get you bail. If very bad, maybe twenty month sentence... But I think we get you bail...
Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins...
Lady...
Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street...
Depends.  You got a memo?
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
What?
You know what I mean...
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
How?!
Your arm, you can't...
Peter...
No shit.
Fuck! It broke the skin...
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
It's right this way.
Sure.
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
No, what is it?
I can take it, go ahead.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
Then who did?
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
Great.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
No, just the paper will be fine.
The "gotta." Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the "gotta."
Nothing.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
A toast?
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
I think you're right.
Ahh!!!
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
What?
What thing?
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
It's good you found it.
I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels?
You think he might be missing?
G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
Newspapers?
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
You're still a writer.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
How do you that.
'Thief in the Night?'
I knew where it was.
I'm not ready!
How much longer before you can reach him?
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
- right..
Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
You didn't do that badly.
Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
Care to wait a decent interval?
They've got a book for this?
Which is?
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
And six billion in the world.
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Can you think of a better one?
I'll muddle through.
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
No...
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
Not necessarily.
'Terrorists?'
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
You mean it'll be difficult.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
Brave girl.  If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice.  But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her.  After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law.  And Hunt.  However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera.  Bring it back alive.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
She must still be on the property.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
They'll kill me.
Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?
I donít know.  It didnít say on the tickets.
This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
Yes.
Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue
Take off your coat.
Who is they, who is they?
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
I always have, Claire..
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
Luther, relax, it's worse than you think. The terminal's in black vault lock-down.
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
Very good.
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
Right, right.  Good.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
What problem?
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
Sure.  If the main character does.
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
Theyíre covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications.  Repeat. Cut all radio communications.
- and picked us up in the States -
I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone.  God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
Loud and clear.
Jack you're so wicked.
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Itís not working.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
What's your news?
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
Let's go tell your Mother.
And what did they say?
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
He's in Palermo.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
Why?
You are going to marry my brother?
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
You really are stupid, you know that.
I was dead.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
But he wants me to come!
Thank you.
Yeah.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
He didn't come!
You're late!
That's right.
This is where we're going!
Yeah.
I'm really afraid.
Is Johnny here?
I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
Johnny.
Yes, on the floor.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
He's my younger brother.
You have a brother?
I have no secrets from my family.
Where's the ring?
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
I don't wanna talk about it.
What! How do you know?
Well. I don't really know where to start.
No more he's not.
It was a miracle.
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
Alright.
I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
Come on in.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
Okay, I'll tell her.
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
What happened?
I'm not disturbed. By you.
None of your business.
What do you do?
I'll remember that. What do you do?
I'm a housewife.
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
Yes.
No.
What? What?
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
And what do you burn, apart from witches?
What?  Ridden on a horse?
...What?
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
One that looks nice.
What is that?
None shall pass.
I've had worse.
I'm invincible!
Ni, ni, ni!
It is the rabbit.
... But all the decision of that officer ...
And the hat.  But she is a witch.
And therefore?
I'm getting better!
I feel happy... I feel happy.
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
To seek the Grail!
Thursday.
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
But I don't want any of that, I'd rather ...
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
Is that clear?
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
No, It's nothing!
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
You got my note!
I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
You watch your tongue.
It's a diary.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
Convey her a message.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
Mama...
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
Do you hunt?
Then I envy yo.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents.  The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that?  However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.
The greasy pole.
No love.
She'll never understand it.
I am.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
To keep out the cold.
Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
I do not accept.
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
No, indeed.
Just them?
Has he been hurt?
Why was I not told earlier?
No.  I shall be out walking.
Ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Good question.  See, that's where the fun comes in.  ARCADE changes it every time. He's a machine without a soul. Once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat.
He's probably outside.  You know how he is. Gets bored...
I came from the city on the left.
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
If they're sick, great.  But let's make sure.  Come on, Nick.
Let's go around back.
We'll call 911.  Look around Alex.  We broke in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to believe what happened here!
Right.  And then communication satellites, and then anywhere.
What?
I know.  It sucks.
Check your read-out.
Never been on a snowboard.
I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
What did you say?
I know.  Where are you Adam?
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
The Cowboy??
Will you meet with him?
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
I understand.
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
Okay.
You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
Come in. I'd like you to meet everyone.
What?
But you won't.
No. I can't.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
I don't know who I am.
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
Okay.
"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
"Before what?"
You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
I know what you have to do, but let me do it.
But I want to.
I just wanted to come here.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
Not a coke or anything?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
Yes.
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Not quite....
Look...
Ow...
Where ?
Don't have to tell me twice.
What ?
What ? Are you my mother ?
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
When you are ready.
You did.
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Checking..... Hah ! He has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets...
Fire the whole division.
We will start work on it now sir.
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
What do you mean sir ?
He's been expecting you.
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
What ?????
I don't know.....
Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
Where are we ?
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
Don't mention it.
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
What boy likes you?
What??
I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.
Hi honey.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
We have a baby?
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
I was pushing as fast as I could.
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
I'm sorry, it's just...I've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and...sometimes it gets out of hand.
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
I've got something better.
oh.
But I wanna write about her.
What can I do for you?
There's water in your bathroom.
MOM!
I don't need you to be telling me to...
TAXI!!!
May I use the phone please.
...I dropped it.
Owh...
Leave me alone!!
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
Here's Judy Garland!
Good. I mean...
Like what?
Rose this not the place to be having this...
A secret, I like that.
This is it I guess.
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
You know where the fire extinguisher is.
You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice.  PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Sort of?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
He's a great poet.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
This guy bonking you?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
No.
Deceased.
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
What's that?
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Is there enough room?
At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
I'll second that.
Dad??
You never cared before.
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
Soon honey, soon.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
Hi.
Feeding my fish.
He's okay isn't he?
Are you sure about all this?
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
My Dad was funny?
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
Come on sweetie.
Thomas?
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Aarrggh.
Oh great!!
I don't want, I don't need your help....
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
I'm allergic to it.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Naah, I don't wanna.
What?
Yes.
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
I am not.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
You're right, let's knock it down.
What do you want it for anyway?
I am running faster!!
Do it!
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
It is not.
No.
... weeks.
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
We're about to find out.
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
Go figure you.
I can't even say it.
What do you suggest?
I'm moving this book to Viking.
To belong to someone.
Good girl.
Can you watch the road?
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
What? Because I'm a little understand...
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
Let me rephrase that...
I was gonna predict that.
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Exactly what?
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
It doesn't say th...
He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
Nobody has.  So far.
At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!
I got the point.
Except for that.
Me either.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
We danced to it.  Just like this.
Well.
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act.  Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
... maybe it's congratulations.
And your point?
Lower.
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
... and you knew about this.
Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
... I'm partial to the tight end.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
Grand Old Opera --
I hate that music.
I won first prize.
I don't want to listen to her sing -
All those people...
I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
Bye, Bye.
Okay. Thanks.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
He's going to run for president.
He has that sign with the tree.
Where the hell have you been?
What crook?
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
I'll just be in here.
Your brother?
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
What is a turkey shoot.
Haven's not going to talk to me.
Can I help you?
She sure sings nice.
She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
What did you say?
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
You got a place to stay?
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Fungus?
Your hair fell out? Just like your father. Weak hair.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
Do you like him?
Linnea?
Yes. Who's this?
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Car pool?
Older.
I'm twenty-eight
Older than thirty?
That's unkind.
Come on, you ever been attracted to a black guy?
Premeditated murder.
What time?
Money's no object.
Where are you going?
Hello.
Where is she?
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
No, we never did that
You do?
He is to a lot of people.
Where are you from?
Ah... Peter Finch.
Who?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
I'll be dammed.
Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
Yes, I would.
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.  So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.
Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
By all means, knock yourself out.
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
What?
You're taking us to that holding cell now.  All right, Cut!
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Was what worth it?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Tell me about the purity.
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
I'm sure we will.
That's indescribable.
Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date.
Yeah, we have a van.
No.
We'll all be killed.
Yes.
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Take a wild stab!
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
Wayne---
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
Wayne Gayle!
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
Okay.
Perfecto!
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
By all means.
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
It sure is.
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
You think so, Frankie?
You in a big hurry, boy?
Well, what d'you know?!
Where was that?
Okay.
Okay, thanks very much.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Okay, I will.
I'm a teacher.
Yes, aren't you?
My father's the preacher.
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
Scared, huh?
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
I didn't know you had one.
Yeah. Well, I do.
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
Don't push me, Duff.
No. But a small one.
Come here, baby.
Huh?
They won't.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
Yeah!
What're you going to do?
Why don't you relax, Frankie?
I bet she's easy jam.
What 'you signifyin'?
What's on your mind?
Yeah. That's right.
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
Okay.
They'll run you out.
No, they won't.
How 'you gonna live?
How are you?
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
I guess I ain't.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
That'll make the folks very happy.
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
Anything you say, baby.
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
Since you got married.  You got someone else to think about now, Danny.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
Don't play with me.
Pity. Then you'll both have to die.
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
Very well.
Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
I'd say you were full of shit.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Good, because you've got a new one.
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
And then?
Linked?
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
You're pleasant tonight.
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
All things possible in Babylon.
I an' I, man. I an' I.
Who got you into this?
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
I said, it's coming. Just get me in, man.
What?
I think you're full of shit.
I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
What's that supposed to mean?
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
Yeah.
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
I'll be okay.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Oh I know.
Yes, it's lame.
Right. Right.
Roger in Op/Ed.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.

Hidden camera.
Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
Transitioned?
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Rob. Please focus.
That's the spirit!
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
You have to say that. You're my student.
I'm thinking when I'm home.
Wait, I was going to tell you--
We're very evolved.
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
Yes.
I can't help it.
There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
It's getting there.
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Don't be a smart ass.
You know what I'm talking about.  What did you use, a fire cracker?  A cherry bomb?
I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Who told you to choke up that way?
Yeah.
Yeah?
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
Who?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I'll get over it.
I don't know - a sharp pain.
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
No.  I'm okay.
We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
Did she always have nightmares?
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.
To old friends.
It's an amazing gift.
You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
It's been a long time.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
Oh God.
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
Call me Nancy.
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
Well, we've got --
So do I.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
Bullshit.  Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good.  Besides, we do have a choice.
No.  We're alone.
Mary Helena.
The bastard son of a hundred maniacs. Some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
This is stupid.
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Yes.  This one though is... very good.
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
No.
Do you always say 'no' to everything?
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Thanks.  Well...
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
Absolutely fine about it.
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
Busy tomorrow?
I was.
Step aside.
I don't know, I'm afraid.
This is the place.
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
Big feet -- large shoes.
You and every person in this country.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
Excuse me?
Hello.
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
And we intend to use them!
Di Caprio.
It was good.
I'll see what I can do.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Well, fire away.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Really?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
Well, there you go.  On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic.
Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
Yes.
Spike!
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Right.
So?
The one down your trousers.
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
Y-y-y-yes...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
Yes, Miss Ratched...
What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
O-o-o-oh...
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Ca-na-da...
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
Sure, Mack...
Yeah!
Huh?
What?
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
It doesn't help him.
I don't trust you!
Gary Blinker...
That's twenty up, Martini.  Hey, Taber, who's pitching the opening game?
Bye-bye.
Okay, Martini. That's okay. Now you watch me.
He's not!
In what way?
I don't, Doc...
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
'Kay, Mac!
Are you a doctor?
You look pretty healthy to me.
How do ya know that?
You're breathin' right now.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
Shhh!  This way!
Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
Our prayers have been answered, Turkle! Our prayers have been answered!
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
What are they?
P.A. What the hell is that?
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
Evenin', ma'am.
Why, sure, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
That!
Is he one of the loonies?
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
Your grandmother?
I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
No.
Your hair... is perfect.
Hi there...
Smoking or non-smoking?
Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
To the foot doctor.
Why are you asking me this?
Because.  I know where he is.
Where's Positano?
I'd really rather not say.
Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
What are you doing here?
We were hungry.
Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
No.  Course not.
No.  Are you're leaving?
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
Yes.
There is no us.
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying. 
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
Only, it's in Italian...
'Course he does.
You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
Larry bought himself cologne?
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it.
And then what, Faith?
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
So, you've had a little bad luck.
I know, but...
...and a fortune teller.
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
Faith, I'm kidding.  Is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
When you could've found one in America.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
I'll come over when I'm ready.
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
I wish I knew.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
That was the idea.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
It's a living.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Mm—hmm.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
I could have been better!
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
Give it to me— my Pop's job—
I can get home all right from here—
How would you've done it?
Do you like pigeons?
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
It's quite—  –nice.
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place—they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
What a fruitcake you are!
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
What for?
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
I know... I know... .
I've been sittin' in the church.
You... .
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley— and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened— I'm frightened.
Get out of my way.
Mind your own business, Father.
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but—
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
My ain't we touchy this morning?
Looking for me?
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
You was a Golden Warrior.
Yeah— us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
No?
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
Now just a minute, I—
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
What are you down here for— to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
Be careful!
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
...And I thought you loved me.
Tie them that they may watch.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
There are others.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
Without the snake, of course.
Did you know that when you married him?
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
Sure looks that way.
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
I don't know.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
What?
And then they'll kill 'em.
I'll go with you.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Wait.  You not Adele?
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller.  He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard.  Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
There a problem, Foley?
I bet.  How much?
Let's go outside and talk.
Someone down here?
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
How many was that?
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
Sure.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
Nothing.
I mean, romantically.
That's my dad.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
How far do we go with this?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
So she did help you?
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
I'll take the shades off.  Just get this fuckin' thing off me.
I don't know...
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
What's to think about?
How are you, Richard?
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
You busted out?
There were others.
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
You're not my type.
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
You not with probation, one of those?
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
Oh, he's moved out?
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
...and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's.
Red...Strange?
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
Of the four left, only one is full of fuel.
Land of the free...
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
Yeah.
I was grieving too.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
Home of the brave.
Yeah.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
Yes'm.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
I had to tell you in person.  Because there's something else I need to say.
Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.
All of 'em.
I'm not telling.
The last one was six hundred years ago. It's about time for another one.
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
On what?
Just what you underlined.
) Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eighty—six.
Would you?
Thanks.
You really love me, don't you?
Charlie. About last nights..
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
I just can't trust you anymore.
Rusty's dead. That's Ajax
That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
What, why?
I wish she hadn't.
But I'm remembering the future.
Right now you're just browsing through time. Choose the things you'll be proud of. The things that Last.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
Coffee and a donut.
I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
I can't do that.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
I think I'm way ahead of them.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Quiet today?
Yes.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
Please don't shout.
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
I'm home now.
Sort of.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
Why not? They're my favorite.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
You're giving me the creeps.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
What if you're not here tomorrow?
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
What are you doing?
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
You sure did...
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
All set.
Sorry about your mom.  I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus...
You never get over it.
In a word, Bob...
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
You'll never find it in the dark.
Whacked with a racquetball.  I appreciate your faith in my abilities.
I said, don't worry about it.
A reaction to AZT...
I promise!
Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
Maybe you should think about it.
I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
Of course.
We're waiting...
He's upset, he's sorry.
One week old.
Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today.
Rayisha. Very nice.
It's me, you dork.
Thank you.
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
You're ready, don't worry.
Except... you were gay?
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
What do you love about it?
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
Where's Dad?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: "whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes, your skin, and now I've got to worry about my kid. What are you doing?
Were you pleased with his work?
We don't think it's fair to keep you here, where your future is limited. But we wish you luck, Andy, all the luck in the world.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Lots.
Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.
Fine, Joe.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it.
Yes, we did.
Like firing Andrew Beckett taught <u>him</u> a lesson?
Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
Jesus.
Charles...
Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
Don't do this to me....
Not sure. Ten?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
You coulda helped. And you didn't.
Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
Quiet, please. Everyone.
No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
What?
I would rather we all stay--
Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Shut up.
Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
Remembers what?
Where did you learn to do this?
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Him.
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
He's trying to form words.
I'll see.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
With one of them.
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
But perhaps he understood --
Yes, Sir.
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
Barnes comes from Hell.
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
...beautiful night.
That's a nice way of putting it.
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
You really think so... us?
Yeah, those are the guys that live. I really don't think Death gives a shit, it's like a giant garbage can, I think it takes whatever it can get... you never know where it's gonna come from anyway... so why spin your wheels?
...there's nobody.
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
How do you do?
Why certainly, baby.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
Whatever you say.
I didn't say anything.
I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
Sure... but somebody always does..
Nice of him.
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
It's always a mistake to run away. Always.
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
Why not?
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
They'll look for you.
Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now.
No.  I paid him off.
You-killed-him?
So that I will never be found.
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I have to kill both of us--
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
If I understand what you meant by that.
I've come here to arrest you for murder.
There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
What will they do to you?
We know everything.
I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
All right. Get him.
Name it.
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
What are your rates?
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
For two hundred?
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
A thousand.
Got it on you?
Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
The usual grind.
That's what I thought, at first.  Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party.  With my liquor of course.
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
A little something on account perhaps?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
Where's the shell?
Do I know who lives down there?
Positive?
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Four different people, Inspector. Three men and a women.  I've made slides for two.  They handled both envelopes.
He checks too.
She might.
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
Who's the girl?
You don't have to make a pose of it.
You already have the checks, darling.
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.
Penfield.  James Penfield.
This is Jill, Carol, Betty, Mandy, Louise, Pete over there, and I'm Carmen.
Hello.
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
Why not.
Not yet you know any of these people?
Ah, ah.  There's more.  The piece celebrates the undying affection between eminent left-wing historian and he dazzling daughter.  Then the news editor, who happened to be in the room, said that years ago, when he worked on The Guardian, Anne Barrington had written a very good piece on...guess...Suez.  It was 1966, the tenth anniversary.
The torture of small children--
Hold those rights.
Will it be fun?
I've known Susan for more than fifteen years.  James, we're old allies.
Not at all.  History.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
Well, she doesn't complain much. You know what she's like.  She keeps asking when you're coming...
Yes, you said.
No, thanks Dad.
Yes.
U-huh.
In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
Voila!
Actually, I've been once today already.  I'll stay here with him.
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
A flaw I'm working on.
Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!
You gotta earn trust.
Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
Babes.
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
This gonna take long?
Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
What?
Warm them up.
They're getting better equipped every day.
Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major...  ... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
You're joking.
What?
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Off the boulevard.
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
Fair enough.
And why do you say that?
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
Vivian --
What?
Five full nights... days too?
Did you buy some clothes?
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
This isn't a date.
You're forgiven.
He died a long time ago.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Fuck off.
I really am sorry.
Shush.  Of course you can.
What happened to him?
Did you?
I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
It was good.
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
It's not your fault.  You're right.  Kit's right.  But I want the fairy tale.
Thank you.
Oh, god, what?
I'm here.
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Yes...
Goodbye, Bill.
I'm up.
Why?
We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
Have a good day, gentlemen.
Edward, we've been together ten years.
Yes.
Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
It was great.
Go for the bucks.
So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a "B."  Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see.
Do I!?  Momma!
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
But I always eat like this.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
Me?
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
'Scume me.
Then I'm here till I die?
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
It never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
I could kill you now.
Who's Guilder?
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
-- where?
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering?  Excuse me --
-- well, when does it get good?
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
Okay.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
Of course.
And our assets?
-- offer me money --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
Again. Thank you.
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
Tell me.
I am not left-handed either.
-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
You've made your decision then7
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody.
Let's hear him.  What have we got to lose?  What's your name?
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
What is she gonna do here?
Double.  Double.  Double.
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Yes.
Vat about it?
Really, I never dreamed ...
We swear it!
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...
Come on.  Let's get going.
All right.  All right.
Ta.  Ta.
By the sacred memory...
Of Siegfried...
The Blue Max...
Good.  Good.  Now ve sign the contract.
People can hear you.
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
What did you tell the people?
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
No.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
Of which morning?
No.
Back where?
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
Like what?
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
Just what he told your detective.
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
A good reason, I suppose.
Huh?
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
No.
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Arbogast said...
Yes.
You're not.
Neither will I.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
I believe it.
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
Hospital clean.
I've lost my girlish laughter.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
You can't laugh at it, huh?
I haven't even been married once yet!
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
No.
I'd like to.
All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella. 
I imagine so.
Why do you ask that?
She sounded strong...
Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
Well? You meant well?  People always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that...
I'm sorry.
He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
I'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman.
Arbogast.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
Leave me alone!
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
What--special autopsy?
Just before she died she came to--
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
That's it. You get it quick.
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
I'd like to have a look.
No, you can't do that--they'll get suspicious--
Nonsense! ... It's here! ... Your blood ...
Yes!
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Léone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
Did you? Where?
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
Why didn't you eat last night?
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
Yeah, but they leave you plenty.
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
I'm not quarreling, only ...
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
I'd love to.
Ralph! Ralph!
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
Let it go.
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
Almost certain.
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
No, sir. About three months ago.
Hotcha! Saved, one job!
Who? Old Santa Claus there? That's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. He's a pushover. Watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
But I have some friends waiting.
You have done well, and now I, too, have something for you. Come.
Dad...
Okay.
Where to?
Dysfunctional --
Wait.  I want to tell you something.
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
Don't mention it.
Well, some fiend might.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
Yeah.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
What was your mother like?
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night! I am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all I am going to do!
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff.
She's getting herself up to go out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
At least.
I can't see, let me see...
What are they doing?
Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Is her husband sick or something?
That's what she would say herself.
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
All right, darlin'.
I'll take him with me downtown.  And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Better off? How could she ever find love and happiness, if you did what you're talking about? Are you insane?
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made her feel guilty this morning --  Brother, what are you doing up?
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
Yes, sir.
Yes, air.
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
Well. What kinda job is it?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Oh, yeah?
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
Let him be guided not by my wishes and not by Rose's wishes, although I am sure they are identical. Let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight.
There are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty and that's all there is to it. Beauty is there and we have to recognize it. Now Rose, the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She looks like an angel and she is an angel, but she can be a naughty angel sometimes, although her father won't believe it. Her real name is Frances, but we call her Dolly or Doll.
More history, Rose.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
I don't mind.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
What and?  That's what I got.
Fair enough.
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
What of it?  Haven't we waited forever... ?  Haven't we, honey?  Haven't we waited long enough to get this scumbag?
Could be worse.  I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
I don't know.  I could quit now if I wanted, I just don't want to.
Bullshit.
It doesn't say that.
What was I supposed to do?
We have to find Kittle.
Speak for yourself.
There'll be other chances.
Where have you been?
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
I... I think I can... clarify...
Murderer?  Really?
You think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? Fuck you!   This is meaningless! You'll never win!  You know, as soon as I'm gone... someone's going to take my place.
Let's hope.
Is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
Chalk up another victory for Billy-Boy's one man war on crime.
Gimmie a minute.
Come again... ?
So are you, Pop-Sweet.  That's why...
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
Yoda spoke of another.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
Where am I?
Wouldn't miss it.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
It'll work. It'll work.
Ahhh...
Lando!
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
All right, hang on.
Red Leader standing by.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
Your father he is.
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
I told you, my car broke down.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
Makes you cry
From Transexual Transylvania.
Now I
My high is low. I'm dressed up With no place to go.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
Shell-shocked!
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
It's not that --
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
What?
Don't tease me.
Don't want weak legs.
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Why?
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
...I don't feel heat from the name.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
...It's very American.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
You think I don't hear things?
A few bucks.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
No action.
Black market?
Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
No -- Just me.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
What?
Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.
Yeah, Kayo.
Rice is a bum.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Think about it.
I'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint.
Yeah.
...What?
Ya got heart.
I got pain an' experience too.
Please, kid.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
...Shrewd.
Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
...No.
The story -- what's happenin'?
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.
Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Oh, no...
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.
Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
That's right, me.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
Why didn't you tell me?
He made me laugh.
What a gasser.
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
Nah, that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
Me.
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
Yeah?
I think you oughta read it to her.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
Is the day so young?
Out--
Teach me how I should forget to think.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
Here comes your father, tell him so yourself.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
That dreamers often lie.
Meaning, to court'sy.
Here's goodly gear!
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
You know it is.
To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
I'm up for that...
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
Nothing.
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we?
You sure about this?
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
We'll double your price.
You first, Edvard.
Not so fast.  Who's that?
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
But you hate each other!
I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
I don't have it with me...
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine.
That's it.
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
If he hadn't you'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago.
Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
Created?
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
Gets the job done.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
Because that's what I would have done...
You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
And what job is that?
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
Thorough man.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him.
Something like that.
So I do it.
If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
Because I don't walk away.
Closest and oldest.
Do you have a good answer?
It's the Irish tape we want.
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
The horniest dog in Nevada.
I hear you.
Oh, you would have done great.
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
Why?
We'll figure something out.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
I...I can't do that.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
You killed him...
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
We've got to go now, then.
Then Sally comes too.
And you're solid on that?
I'm not gonna take --  I'm not gonna take it in stride.  I had a good run turn to shit on me like that -  cleaned me out.
No.  It's not.
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
How the hell did he find it?
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
I love you.
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
I swear to you, it's true...
Could it have been this?
Speaking of which that reminds me I have to bring something home or eat Sally's meatloaf again, and I don't think I could stand that.
We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Lingerie...
Hi.
Hmmm...
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
I don't know...
Shut up!!!  Slut!!!
True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl?
Just do it!  Meet me there, now.
Listen -
You're never getting that much.
I think I am.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
So...what's the good news?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
No, I just assumed...
Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?
How much is that?
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
I ain't his partner, I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See, I got a mini-bar key.
No.  It's my first time.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
I knew you were lying.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
Try to land on your feet.
Well, hurry up.
This is a very dangerous man.
It's my job!
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Not Yu.  You!
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
You pull a muscle or something?
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
What's going on?
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
It's your turn!
I don't need a turn!
She never even looked at you.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
How was the sex?
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
No mu-shu.
Steamed dumplings?
Follow me my Asian brother.
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
No you didn't!
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
Any leads?
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
Shut up!
Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns.  That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
I know a shortcut.
You know War?
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
It's okay. For restaurants.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
What?!
Or somethin'.
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
I'm not running.
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
What did he ask?
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
"Make the shot."
What?
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
Where do you think she's going?
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
Tootaloo.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Oh, come on.  You're practically family.
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
You have one?
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Maybe someday.
No.  You take it.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Excuse me?
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
I'd rather not.
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
It's something I've always wanted to do.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Why?
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
Good boy, Port Hole.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
Yeah.
Nope.
It sounds nice.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
No, that's free.  He's an architect.  Used to do big high-profile projects.  He scaled it all back when his wife died.  Now he remodels people's homes.  He works in a small firm, makes a good living.
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
Am I what they had in mind?
They're going to love you.
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
I don't think so.
Okay, okay.
Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
You couldn't.
I do.
I think that's what I'm saying.
Look!
Nothing's with me.
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
Thank you.  I love you.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
Made for each other.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
What are your plans in New York?
I love the symphony.
Howard.
Any time.
How did it happen?
Mom, we already...
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
It's not that late in Seattle.
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
And you're worried about him.
I don't know --
I don't think I have to now.
We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
It's never happening again. Right?
You're right.  You better hope so.
I think I know how to have a spice rack.
Somewhere in the middle.
Whose show was this on?
Jed's got cables.
I'm starting to forget her.
It's only ten o'clock.
This conversation is finished.
Did too.
No.
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
Yes?
Microwave.  Five minutes.
I'm sorry --
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
Sure.  Sure.
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
How's it going?
Whose side are you on anyway?
I don't make policy.
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
You're a liar, Pancho. A no-good, dirty ...
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
Backward.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
Hunting.
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
Or why don't you just put a sign outside? "No dogs or women allowed!"
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
It's possible. Just negotiate.
The what!
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
You mind?
It's downright classy is what it is.
Colette ...
Nothing.
Don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.
I can't.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Like you?
Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
Therapy session is over.
I'm kind of busy.
He knows where I work.
Ass first into the world.
They would have killed you too.
Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
Guess it's our turn.
Finland is a country.
You on a roll?
I find myself in dire need of some cash.
No. I'm good.
Thanks for not laughing at me.
You don't trust me?
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
I'm sorry. I couldn't.
Understand what?
No, I'm good.
Hey, okay.
If you say so.
Pull your pants down.
I'm sorry?
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
Tell me what?
Question is, what are you doing here?
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al?
Whata you mean?  He told me -
That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
Worse. Much worse.  A teacher.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
That is so unfair.
Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
Don't worry about it.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
Where are your men now?
Spit it out, Captain.
Hell, no.  I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none.
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
I'd love to hear it.
Wade?
My guess, too.
Keep trying.
A half-track, anything.
It seemed appropriate.
I don't expect to live that long.
The men said, nine.
Same place we are.
Sure, you got one?
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
What about the company?
Fresh out.
Yep, hell of a mission.
That's not what we're here for.
Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
You're kidding yourself.
Vecchio.
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Sure, what do you want to know?
Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
See to it.
Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
What are we likely to run into?
Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.
Who knows?  It worked.
How can you, how can you say that?
Because he's guilty.
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
I hope you understand.
Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
Going out as friends.
Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
I can put that together.
Alright.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
I love you dad.
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
You're going.
Dad, why are you acting this way?  Is this because of the other morning?
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
Honey!
Swear to god.
Yes, I...
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
I'm so ashamed dad.
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Well, not monumentally.
Look Diane, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to leave the country without going to Valhere's graduation party.  This gentleman, he's twenty-two, and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion, and he dresses up as the Lakeside rooster, and he,
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
Today is tomorrow.
Okay, bye, I will.
I'm doing alright.
Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
Well, I need to study, and...
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
You shared it with a dick.
Did you talk to Corey?
Just my dad.
I'm sorry.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
I love you.  Please, I love you.
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
Your car?
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
I love you man.
Now you're back.
He is.
I'm sorry to hear that.
In Breslau.
Look it up.
Yeah, I can.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
You're a good man.
I don't know, ten or twelve.  That's a good color.  Dark blues, grays.
Wine?
Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
What others?
So I'll talk to him about it.
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product.  They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
Thank you.
Are you losing money?
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
Well, sure.  So would I.  So would you. I wouldn't worry about it.  We'll get it right one of these days.
I didn't do enough.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
Take the neighborhood.
On national television.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
That's too bad.
I thought you were going to the mixer?
Just some asshole trying to scare me.
What?
Not until you’re dead.
Gale, I don't know what I'm doing from one moment to the next. I'm just taking it as it comes.
Home--where he lives.
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
But you’ll never get away with it.
No way.
Good question. You took the bait.
And watch her til 8:00--I've got to edit.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
I know that.
Yeah?
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
What are we looking for?
C'mon. Let's go.
Don't worry...
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
I'm everywhere.
It's good to see you involved.
My morn was a Delta.
Gotta.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
I counted four.
I just love being a sister.
She's not here right now.
But she's standing right next to you.
Now.
Shush.
What are you talking about?
Where you going?
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
Hello.
Asshole, Can't talk.
Thanks.
I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
More of a game really.
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
Is that a threat?
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
No.
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Where are you Dewey?
You used to say that was our strength.
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
I'm on duty.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
Just Jennifer.  And you.
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
Oh shit it's my cell!
Possibly.
They're the ones who approved it.
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Who's this.
What are you talking about?
I know! He killed Kincaid!
Roman that's not the line.
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
Are you sure?
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
What's that?
Hey, hey, it's just me.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
What?
Yeah... I think so.
No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
Who are you trying to reach?
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
No.
I want to now who I'm talking to.
That's not what you said.
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
Come on. It'll be fun.
Come on. It's you favorite scary movie, remember? He had a white mask, he stalked the baby-sitters.
No it's not. It was Jason.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
No, not yet.
He's not a suspect, is he?
Yes, you doofus.
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
Yes, sir.
I told you to send it back.
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
Not my daughter... not my...
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
What's the delay?
Just stay back.
I want to talk to you.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
Why would she lie about it?
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So where are you?
What am I doing?
Can you knock?
I heard screaming.
Got it.
Sleep tight, sweetie.
Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
Wanna another beer?
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Are you serious?
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
I'm not worried.
Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did.
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
Deal.
That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
Tits -- see.
How's that?
Announcing what?
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
One is gluttony.
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
Yeah, that's true.
Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
Her pretty head.
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
In two months, no one's going to even remember this happened.
It's going to be flawless.  People will barely be able to comprehend it.  It will seem almost surreal... but it will have a tangible reality, so they won't be able to deny it.
I meant to ask you something, Mills, when we spoke on the phone.  I can't help wondering... why here?
Then, why are we wasting our time?  This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham.  If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
What about them?
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
This is just to satisfy my curiosity.  I'm still leaving town Saturday.
Punishing.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Oh, that's all.
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
The fingerprints.
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
I don't.  Neither do you.
You do the talking.  Put that old silver tongue of yours to work.
Think about how we got here!
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
Kiss me on the lips.
I can't do this now... please.
I don't sleep very well.
I don't know...
It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
They gave up...went back to the cotton rows...So'd the Jamisons... Without Martha, I don't know...She wouldn't let a man quit.
How many, would you say?
Yes sir...We've received information about a band of Comanches under a chief named Scar...
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
You got it with you?
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
Well...I know there were some captives recovered...
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
You all settled an' comfortable now?
He just couldn't wait...
What?
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
Not no more.
It's what I'm countin' on.
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
Time's running out...But I'm obliged to you.
Dear Miss Laury...I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Com- anches the late Mister Futterman told us about...
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
It wasn't much of a letter...
You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
Making our very own solstice fire.
Cherry-red Tears.
If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
We should leave the past alone.
I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
Right you are, governor!
You have the money?
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
See you in jail.
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
Ned is wrong for it.
And yet you tell me you lie with women?
No, no. You have a wife, children
So now you are free to love
Of course not!
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
Oh, that.
God be praised!  Locked?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
I don't know. It's a mystery.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
Romeo is…Italian. Always in and out of love.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
The daughter of his enemy.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
As a nurse.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Stand up straight, girl.
There was a wager, I remember…as to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love. I think you lost it today.  You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
"Ay me."
"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
If they find you here they will kill you.
Oh, not for the world!
I am.
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
Oh
It was the owl--come to bed
You never spoke so well of him.
and thus unable to declare her love
Nor you for me.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
My hat?
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself.
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
Just serve.
Can I show you something?
No.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
Dig the pit, I don't know.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
Is that going to be deep enough?
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
Not now. I have an idea.
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
You're not eating.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
But more laughter than tears, I think? Yes. On balance? I mean, remember that time when -- oh, we could talk all night, but we have to go. Don't we, Juliet?
About the mail --
Don't know what?
And you like it?
Yes.
Cameron?
Just serve.
For the flat.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
What?
Stop nagging.
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
Who was it?
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
No, no, it's different.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Alex.
What?
did you hear anything before he cries?
Of course.
Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
Exactly what I was --
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
That's what I thought.
All right.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
For what?
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
Don't you like her?
Who?
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
What are you talking about?
You mean that girl, don't you?
What?
I don't know.
I don't want to talk about it...
Calm down, baby.
Like what?
Then it's not your problem.
Hello.
No thanks.
See if you've been making it with my mother.
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
Right, that's right.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
You promised you'd do the show.
You do it.
He's a very private person, actually.
It's hot in here.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
Did Lester know about him?
Did you?
Hey, I don't tell.
You did, didn't you?
You did, I know you did.
You're a genius.
-- what guy?
He's a director.
Jackie, can we --
He still having parties?
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
Look about last night --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
No --
So I'm saying it...
What's that supposed to mean?
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
-- you know better...
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
Keep moving --
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
You're great.
Do you really mean that?
Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
You've never even been around one.
Yeah.
Okay...  Night, baby.
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
Great.
Whether or not I'm going.
I'll call you.
Never mind. Where've you been?
Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
What do you wanna know for?
Please!... that's not like you.
George...
What did you say?
I said you were a loser!
-- A wash and set.
Said what!
In a way. But...
Oh yeah?
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
... this doing hair it's...
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
I'm finished with her.
Wasn't sure it was you.

A daytime soap opera.
Who do you think I was talking to?
What's that?
You're still jealous.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's right.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
George is great but I know what you mean.
But you have problems?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Well, you know what I mean.
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
Is he an enemy?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
Do you have something against traveling?
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Where to, Les?
Yes?
Do you like this hotel?
No.
I'm not supposed to.
Who's Tony?
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
I won't, Mom.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Do I have to?
Yes.
Sure.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Oh, they're somewhere around.  I'm not quite sure at the moment, sir.
Well, he is a very willful boy.
Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
Sure.
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Good.
And you didn't see anything at all?
Good.
Yes.
Jack...
Stay... stay away!
Jack, stay away from me!
I'm Jack Torrance.
Not for me.
Well, my predecessor in this job
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
Blue. This blue.
Sure, Uncle Al.
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
Brady's a booger and so are you!
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Where's Mom?
Will you marry me, Jane?
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
No.
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Good.
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
Marty, do you see your suspect?
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
Were you tempted?
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
Whatever.
I knew that.
I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
You re okay -- for a civilian.
Five a.m.?
A novice.
She won't?  Why not?
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
Keep moving!
Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
I see.
A what?
Yes.  Until breakfast.
But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.
Out of the question.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm gonna go back, work things out with Vince.
Pray. 
I've been worried about you.
I have?
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
That's not the point!  They need me!
Really.
They open a window.
You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.
Yeah...
Maybe pants.
We're losing it.
That should have tipped us.
Yes?
Which convent was that, Sister?
He's decent.
Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
Can you hold?  Can you try?
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this...
A diseased monster.
You will stay at her side?
What?
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God.
A fine idea.
Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning.
The militia?
I know it.
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
What kind of nuts?
Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
What does it mean?
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
You are funny.
To avenge his father, and the others.
What has happened?
His horse.
We have no choice.
I didn't see none.
Doctor, he is awake.
There was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss, one old boy from California and one old boy from Arkansas. Old boy from California says, "Boy this water's cold." Old boy from Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep too."  Get it? That's a goodun.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
How are you, Bill?
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
Yeah.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
They was a boy. We made friends.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
You know what we ought to do tonight?
You don't have to do anything but pour some potato chips in a bowl and bring beers out when we get low.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
Leave.
No sir.
No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your mama. This is your mama's decision, not yours. I'm lettin' it go on because she asked me, not you.  Now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that, 'cause I have trouble eatin' around that kind of thing. Just like I am about antique furniture and midgets. I can't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture. Same thing with a droolin' retard.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
You enjoying yourself, Karl?
You believe in the Bible?
Childers.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
But maybe just for awhile --
Childers.
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
How come?
You told me to come by.
They sell some of everything. Come on let's go. I won't tell her about you bein' in the state hospital for killin'.
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
How did your mama die?
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
Two people.
I thought they was.
Maybe they needed it.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
Yeah.
A little ol' boy.
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
Yeah.
We'll be on teams, me and you?
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Yes sir.
I'm glad of it, honey.
They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
Naw.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
Do they know about you?
My history.
I'll be.
Tolerable, I reckon.
Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
I didn't aim to.
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
I believe you. I really do.
Well, okay. I got you some.
He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.
What brings you back?
Did you knock on the door yet?
Naw, I ain't.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
I'm sorry.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Why won't he talk to women?
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
An invitation?
I confess.
And your father? Is he from New York?
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
Huh?
What about for you?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
It's yours?
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
A photographer ...
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Ready. Any time you are.
Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
Open it.
What is this, some kind of joke?
And these?
Thanks for the tip.
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
What does that mean?
I just want to know where he is.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
And his parents?
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
No thank you.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
It'll cost you five bucks.
It was just a thought.
Hi there, little brother.
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
Baby? And what baby is that?
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
Of course. Where else?
Yeah, that's right.
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
Three nights.
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
You too. And make sure the light is green before you cross the street.  Oh, by the way, I liked your book. I think you're a hell of a good writer. 
I don't know. For helping me out.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
Let's not get too idealistic.
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Absolutely. We would be honored.
Yeah, it might be.
Here, catch.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
It's all right. I really do know them.
I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was asked only t...
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
Why?  If they could never take title.
That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
Is that your third question?
You're implying th...
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
The Japs did it.
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
Yes, he was.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
I think you like learning.
Maybe.
It is.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
What else could it be?
I wouldn't say encouraged.
Mmmmmm.  Weeell, you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying...
Such as?
I suppose you want a tip?
Beat it, Buster.
All right, girls.  Who does this belong to?  Come on, now.  Speak up.  Sugar, I warned you!
You're welcome.
It's entirely mutual.
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
Those two musicians from the garage!
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
Fight it.
How can we?  We're broke.
Me?  After Sugar?
Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
Security.
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
I'm Sugar Cane.
Good night, honey.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Yeah - Josephine.
Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
Neither can I.  Come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
You don't say.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
Most of the time I slap it.
Oh, you don't get off that easy.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
I forgive you.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
We'll take it!
I'm not very bright, I guess.
Have you ever been with a male band?
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
Every time!
Yeah.
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Seventy-five.  That's three-quarters of a century.  Makes a girl think.
Saxophone player?
You're not hurt, are you?
Now, really -
Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
- riding to hounds -
You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
You collect shells?
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
What?
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Harmless - how?
You mean - like frigid?
Nothing at all?
Have you ever tried American girls?
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
Did you have a nice time?
Me?
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
PLEASE!
Coffee?
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
I sleep with my spats on.
Yes, sir.
And who runs it?
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
Drunk isn’t the same thing as happy, Amy.
Pub Golf?
If Ed ever found out....
And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they haven’t made up since.
Fair enough, but I’m stepping on toes here and you’re waltzing around like...
You Yanks and your therapy. It’s great.  It’s all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like we’re trying too hard to look like we fit.  It’s welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
I’m compulsive and weird?
I do?
Your “friend” guaranteed my anonymity.
Oh, no.
And you thought I’d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
When you’re ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
I disappear. It’s not about me.
Not dollars. Pounds.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
Oh, cut the crap!
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasn’t one of them.
Make out with you for free.
You have more than one gynecologist?
You knew?
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Hard.
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Now who says I didn't lay my mark on you, boy!
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
Yes, Daddy! Yes!
Goodnight.
Children, come here...
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
Ask your daddy to give you some word about when he'll be comin' home -- and tell 'im we love him.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
Yes, ma'm...
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
But, Miss Boatwright, you--
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
They probly thought you was crazy.
Whatcha got there?
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
I just got out here!
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
I wanta see Nathan.
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
Doggy.
That book wasn't Canadian!
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
Oh.
pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
Your behind?
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
Sure, dude.  On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby...
What the hell are you guys doing here?
Sure, hon. Goodnight.
God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
Help yourself prickfuck!
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
No, Eric... I'm afraid it's phase two for you...
I know what it is!
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
A deal? You wanna make a deal with the devil. Well sure, deals are mounds o' fun.
Uhh... I don't know.
FREEZE!!
Yeah, I guess.
That's gonna take a long time!
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
YOU BASTARD!!
I don't know, dude.
Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
Wait! Before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
Wow!
I thought you had something planned.
Sweet.
Are you sure, Kenny?
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
I sure did, Phillip!!
Cheers, Terrance!
Don't believe the hype!!
Terrance! NO!
You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh?
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
Cool!
You're Warren Wayne.
It certainly is.
All right, I'll give it a shot.
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
That's me.
I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
I know, I know.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
I don't know.
Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
Great.
Wait.
Ready as I'll ever be.
Sure.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
Taylor!  Where are you?
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
It would matter to us.
He's in the bathroom.
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
The engines!
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
I know but we're in a bind.
One moment please...  one moment please...
I'm sorry.  The suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated, zero gravity atmosphere.  I'm afraid that's off limits to all passengers.
Can I get you something for the road?
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
- canker sore.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
Who gave it to you?
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
I'm your blood.
Don't say that about my mom!
You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
I found dad.
Cool!
Theo. Howzitgoin.
I don't want to play.
I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
Nice set-up.
I like the sport the way it is.
Look who's talking!
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
Four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for Team Kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment.
Strokin'. Here goes nothin'.
Uh...over easy.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
What's plan C?
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
I could let them go for ten.
What about the guy he put in the body cast?
Zip.
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
I told him you were my boyfriend.
I didn't stop to take his pulse.
At least I'll die smiling.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
I am a professional man.
You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
I can't see...
Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
What if it attacks?
It's either that or we grow gills.
Then why am I here?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
-- Wait a second --
It's impossible.
What team?
Everything can be killed.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
Just worry about yourself.
I think I do.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence.  It's smart.  It's approaching us in a simple way.  Like you would a dog.  Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
Then how can it be chipped?
Yes, Harry.
Ted seems to have some ideas.
It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
I have to tell you.  It's strange.
What is it?
What?
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
Yeah.  Drowning.
Good theory, Ted.
Yeah, why?
What could have done this?
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
So what?
Don't tell me to calm down!
Don't do this.
It's not worth the risk.
You don't trust me?
Still clear.
I think so, Beth.  Yes.
The refridgerator.
None of this was here before.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
What?
Squids?
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
I don't know.
How can the sphere do that?
A synthetic opium analogue.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Bingo.
How long does it last?
Three to six hours.
You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
I did do that, didn't I?
That's bullshit.
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
Get away from the door, Beth.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Leave me alone, Norman.
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
Get away from me!
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
For whoever's in that thing.
Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
Another attack?
Like what?  I'm not --
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Fine.  I'm fine.
Wait a second, I --
Our present.
I don't follow you.
Am I?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
Her suit's gone.
I thought she was with you.
But why would she -- ?
I don't think so.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
Arrived?  From where?
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
The ships?
Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
What report?
Still, make a note I recognized that.
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
What do you mean?
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
Have you been checked out?
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Why?
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
Are you safe?
Good.  We're right above you.  Stand by.
Well, maybe you better look again.
It's what I deserve.
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Sir, no, sir.
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
Funny...
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
Excuse me...!
Is it true ?
Excuse me...!
Why not ?
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
Good luck at the academy.
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
You don't look very happy to see me.
Should I be ?
Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
We've gotta go get her !
Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow all instructions of you supervisor.
Yes, ma'am.
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Uh, look, Diz...
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
You saying you didn't ?
Flip six, three hole.
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
What ?
Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
Teenagers !
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
No, sir.
Uh, no.
Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you...
Not a problem.
V'ger is that which programmed me.
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
Who is V'ger?
You may proceede.
<U>Why</U>?!
You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
The information will not be disclosed.
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
May I ask Why?
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
It's taken control of the computer...!
You got the Enterprise, it's what <U>you</U> wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim...  ... <U>I'm</U> the right choice for this mission.
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
Thrusters ahead, one third.
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Tractor beam remains constant...
Sure plan to.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
You haven't heard of it.
I quit the movie.
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech.  Just you.
I <u>can</u>?
You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
No, I don't...
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
Cast stood me up.
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
You got a paperclip?
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
You believe that?
I do if you do.
It used to be the Old Mill.
They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
...yes.
What?
...and we could get up every morning...
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  Both up with the chickens.
But it'll stop the movie.
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
Hi.
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Wat...
Uh, <u>look</u>....
I <u>know</u> my lines...
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant."
Everybody needs a hob...
Of course he...
Thank you.
I, uh...  Um...
<u>You</u> know...Where's your bathroom?
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
Oh.
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
Now, look.  Claire:  Listen to me.  I want to tell you a story.
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
I can't tell.
You said <u>three</u>...?
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
Doug, the traffic light...
Okay...
Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
My wife's going to have a baby.
Yes.
A witness to what...?
I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
You know, they told me there were gonna be some jokes.  Kid the New Guy...
You want me to lie.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
No.
That's thoughtful.  Ziz good, you try this?
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
I don't got the money.
<u>Find</u> it.
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
There's no witnesses...
...not at all...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
...it is?
George, that is so kind of you.
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
I killed her!
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.
I'll be there for you.
She is but an arriviste.
Actually.  I could only help him.
This is a joke, right?
This is my daddy's house --
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
That doesn't bother me.
Annabelle put down that camera.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
Nope.  I got my warm t-shirt.
That's Rache's song!
Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
Oh.
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
Good...Well...Take care.
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
And I'm supposed to care.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
Jackie?
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
You WHAT?
Nobody likes a snoop.
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
Don't be too sure.
Give 'em my number.
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
I lost him.  I was panicked.
You'll learn.
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
Yeh, it's cheaper.
But?  But what?
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
You haven't done <u>one</u> goddam thing to make any of this easier...
I think so...What do you think?
Are you hungry?  You could make us something?
I know that.
I needed some time away.
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
But it's not like real work. This is just babysitting.
Oh. How did it happen?
Maybe it's for the best…I mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrong…People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
I know!
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
Nothing, I guess…
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
You started filling out your college applications yet?
But then, in a sense, since you would never have met Dad if your family had stayed in Europe...if it weren't for Hitler, none of us would have been born.
Fine.
Ready for tomorrow?
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
Whaddya mean you don't know? You either got a lot or you don't. What's not to know?
We have to talk.
Come here, give me a hug!
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
Thank you for being honest.
Take off your top.
Again!!
No.
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Thanks.
You know...I like you.
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
Why? Are we going dancing?
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
We're outta here--
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Good...
The maintenance hatch--it takes us outside the building!
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
They were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time--without anyone being the wiser...
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
Richter-we got a problem!
At his office in the Capitol.
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
That's nonsense, and you know it!
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
General Schmuck?
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
Certainly, General.  Why do you ask, sir?
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
You're right, sir.
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
That's right, Major.
That is correct, Major.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
How much soda, sir.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
Do you think we'd cheat?
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
How long will it take to receive them all?
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Have you tried the recall again?
Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
General, stick to the point, please.
What?
War?
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
They can't touch us at this height.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Primary arming switch.
Some kind of signaling.
No kidding.
Forget it.
Shoot, Lothar.
As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?
What happened?
Listen, give me a shot quick!
Quentin, how's your gear?
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
Look, this is different.
That's the point.
I said that's the point!
Roger.
What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
I don't anymore.
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Yeah, I guess.
You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result.
Typical male.
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Sounds like a bummer.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Do you wanna go to the van?
Yeah.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
No.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
What?
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Buff is funny. God.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the salt is rotten or the meat."
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
Hey, thanks, man.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
He is?
Mm.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
I'd love to read that.
Always two-fifty, my friend.
Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
Nobody. Sooze.
Right on. You know what? He doesn't need the limo, man.
No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
You lied to me.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
Well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops and I'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
So you can give me more shit?
I would've stopped it.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
My goal is to make art.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No, I don't.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
Oh, yeah?
What?
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
No, it's not...
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
So how's college?
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
Yeah, really.
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Yep.
Yeah.
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
The fuck not?
You know the fuck not.
Wayne Gretzky.
Excuse me, Vendela, have you seen Diane? We're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight.
Spit from your dad?
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Oh... What are you working on?
He is the Great One...
Yeah, hold on.
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
I-I'm sorry - can someone else please run the Ouija board?  It's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
You damn well better...
Definitely old.
Maybe we can make a deal.
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
Your help.
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
That was the general idea.
Close, but no cigar.
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
Someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
As a matter of fact.  I've given up writing altogether.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
It's just impossible.
You're tough, all right.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
So do I.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
If you please.
It must be my new shampoo.
Why not?
I don't want it now.
You did.
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
And you'll play Salome?
Fair enough.
I am not afraid.  Read it!
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
December twenty-first.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
There sure is.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
Cut away from me?
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.

I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
Thank you, darling.
Good night.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I went for a walk.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
Yes, I am, Norma.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
He had a great big bungalow on wheels.  I had the upstairs.  See where it says 'Readers' Department'? I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
You say the cutest things.
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
Gillis, get this through your head.  I'm not just your agent. It's not the ten per cent.  I'm your friend.
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
Yes, Madame.
You know better than to interrupt me.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
But which one?
That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
Western Europe.
It's for your own protection.
Later.
When can I see, you again ?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Well...I guess one is all right.
I sort of like what you said.
That makes it worse.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
Theories?
Oh, no thanks.
Oh, sure.
It's going to be a tree, I think.
Can you create life?
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
Must've been a defective puck.
It doesn't seem right.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
Nonsense.
I don't scare that easily.
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
Buddy, are we in trouble.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
Nope.  Never. 
The kid needs a man to show him --
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
You thought that?
I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Uh-huh.
Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
Mom and I do this all the time.
What are you doing?
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
Or socks.
'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
God, that's what I keep you for.
The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Is this whitemail?
What will it do?
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
We've already met.
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Where's the light switch?
Gus?
You've got to pick three more numbers.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Why do I have to do this?
He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
TOMORROW THE OIL!
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Hostages?
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
I do?
I'm listening.
Let's get you inside . . . .
Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
Uh...home...
You'll have to pack quickly.
North!
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
I'll be alright.
It's beautiful.
I think he said a "curl."
North.
Oh magnificent one. What I am bargaining with is what you do not have -- the son  of Jor-El.
The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Put down Lex Luthor?
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion ... although ...
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
What about here?
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
Lacy. . . I . . .
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
N-no...I mean...you bet.
Go on . . .
Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
Who?
I must have miscalculated. How. . .
Get the box, nephew.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
You are . . . nothing. I am father now.
Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great!
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
Bunkers!
Shut up, apple-polisher.
A hot story, huh?
Lois isn't here?
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
No.
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
Jealous? Of what?
You're not the only one.
You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
La de da da...
Ready.
You have two minutes and thirty- two seconds.
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
A night on the town instead of under it?
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
I'm wearing it.
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
Lara, please...
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
Do as I say. Let go!
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
Can you really see through anything?
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
I gave him steady employment --
I...uh...check.
I guess I...uh...regressed.
Couldn't have said it better myself.  Now all this  --  --  west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here  --  --  is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well...  ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point --  --  that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.'  Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know...
We're...not together.
Yes...fine.
Are you still in touch?
Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Alison.
I hope she gets better.
I'll tell her that.
I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel.
Why are you telling me this?
Was it good?
I don't know.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
I'm not sure.
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
That's because he misses you.
Why?
Well I don't.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
Berries.
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
Did his parents attend to that?
Did they give him special care?
I did.
Anything you didn't understand?
You hate it.
We've only got honey.
Yes.  It's a present.
No.  What's this lawyer business?
Did he say what about?
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
You hate that.
I don't want you to lie.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
Will you be spending more than a night?
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
Almost three.
Here we go.
Thanks.
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
Do you have the blood test?
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
Who are you?
I'm a lawyer.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
You've been retained?
Their child died, and they got a lawyer.
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Before the actual accident?
Seventy-two miles an hour.
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
Of course.
And I had to widen a few doors. You'll see.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to.
I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
Great.
But of course...
Alone or surrounded?
You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
No, I wouldn't...
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER  I'm not fighting with you, puss...
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...
Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here!  Or will I be hearing next that I don't even have my sister's welfare at heart...
Now don't kid a kidder.
Why does everything you say sound like a threat?
Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
I have a message from your sister.
I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.
Get Steve back his job...please...
I read your column every day...
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
We stick in each others craw.
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
No shit?
I love you, John.  I always have.
I know, Mom.  I know.
Oh.  Yeah.  They... make me take this stuff...
And what it that?
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
Yes.
Respect your elders and your betters!
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
Don't. This is like a criminal investigation, David. Musicians, morticians, doctors, lawyers, butchers, clerks. They're all the same.
They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
Yes.
and totally irrelevant.
Not so, Counsellor. That secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? As many and as often as you wanted.
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
You do shorthand and typing?
Three months.
Says here because of your father. What's that mean?
Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
It's the truth.
Your guess is as good as mine.
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
What did Goering say?
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
Do you know what's in this archive?
How could I know what's in the archive?
Yes, you remember.
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
One of your people told me.
His private life?
He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Come to the office, please.
Thanks, Chuck.  I need the money.  Can I still work the hours around my classes?
Don't wear the beige one.
You must have a girlfriend.
What's it to ya?
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
You'll learn.
Okay.  Talk some more.
Molecular-memory.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.
Hot dogs?
Don't say that.
A girl.  You know.
And so you feel nothing.
We did it, Kyle.  We got it.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
Alright, Ms. Connor.  Listen carefully.  You're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  Stay visible. Don't go outside or in the restroom.  I'll be there in a few minutes.
Okay.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
I know.
I just called.
Call her again.
Shut up.
Now, look...
You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
He's turning blue!
If there was one.
No.
What's C.R.S.?
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
They said five hundred.  I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit.  I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
Where'd you get this?
What's wrong?
Wha... ?
Not here!  They can see.
Yeah?  I was your waitress on your birthday.  Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember?  I was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
What... what do you mean?
That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
Let me show you...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
No...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Underwear?
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Which grad-school?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
Call them.  Trust me.
But, will you?
Why would you say that?
What's this all about, Connie?
We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
I hope.
What's all this for?
And if nothing's lacking?
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard.
Don't take another step.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
What?
Cancel lunch.  Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts.
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
Nothing else?
You're joking.
Attempted murder.
Greetings.
She got the child labor stuff from me.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
No.
Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer!  And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration...
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
No.
Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something.
What?
Because it's my phone.  Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you.
No, but Nell's been here longer than I have.
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
Why'd she kill herself?
What did it cost?
No.
I know.
No.  The world has missed you.
David.
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
I have a loft.
Not for you, clearly.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
Why?
I'm sorry.
We can't find ...  ... two of our guys.
Come over here.
Not bad.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
I thought he was in prison, in England.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
Let him break - he likes to break.
Huh?
You're in gun country now, my friend.
Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market.
It was better than a telegram.
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ...  Those curves don't kid around.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
Has he?
Faith.
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will?  What more do you want, man?
The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
Uh-huh.
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
Hell, no.  I started writing.
Hard to miss.
Not her brand.
No, why did you come here?
No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
That's what was estimated.
Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
What do you think.
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
Pushing the legal limit even then.
You ever been to London?
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
What about your grandmother?
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
How far?
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
So what's your beef, pal?
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
You sure?
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
Since when?
Susan.
Who's looking for you?
You must know Ian.
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Ann--
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
Who?
Huh.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
Ed.
Cash?!
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
Honey...
I knew we'd pay for it.
No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
...OK.
*I* was with her.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try.
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
Yeah, the best.
I don't work here. My wife does.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
What the--
What the hell are you talking about?
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
You'll go to the prison hospital.
Under arrest for murder.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out.  That lock was torn off from the <u>inside</u>.
Calm down.  I found it!
Let's go!
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
May I see that?
Oh shit.
Right.  The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please?
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
They're eggs.
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
I think so.
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
I wouldn't be so sure.
Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Frock's been fired.
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph. Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the definitive word from Cuthbert's secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last week.
There's another possibility.  A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
It's reptilian.
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
And John?
You were going to be married.
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
A monster?
No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
I don't understand.
I don't know.
We need someone to take us to the secure storage area.
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
That would fit.  It's nocturnal. Quick.  Come inside.
Then it won't go after the others?
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
It's coming.  Run.
I can't!
<i>Fiji.</i>
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
All prop cars accounted for?
Let me demonstrate some examples.
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
<i>You</i> were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.
--You never had a camera in my head.
Sure she would.
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
Nursery?
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
How about them?
This is where it started.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
Every time you and Marlon--
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
I know.
Your mother called.  You shouldn't upset her like that.
I don't know--
Put some butter on it--or ice?
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
I bet you did.
How's your hip?
Who?
You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
Well, we're FBI agents.
No, they don't.
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
Kurtzweil, we think.
You got some kind of business with him?
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
Yeah, I did.
No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
Negotiating with whom?
That would be my guess.
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
Did you find something?
No. I haven't.
What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
I was until about an hour ago.
I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
What did you find?
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
For the purpose of what?
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
General McAddie's.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
I want to know where Scully is.
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Where is he?
What about you?
My life is over.  Go.
I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
Lucien Baines?
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
Nothing.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
What happened?
What then?
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
If you believe that.
Yep.  Eloped.
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
No.  Thank you.
Already there.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
I doubt that.
Grandparents.  Live over in Davis.
It's his dog.
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
Next time, tell me, okay?
Ja, ja, ja.
He was Harry's driver?
I was told there were only two men there.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
I thought you wanted...
It's all right.
How do you know?
Oh, well.
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
Of course.
We loved each other, do you mean that?
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
This is forgery. It is very clever.
Holly Martins.
I can't say that I have.
Oh, pinning things on girls now.
You're not locking her up?
Bring him in.
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Fifty yards right down there.
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
Two thirty.
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
Is that what you say to people after death? "Goodness that's awkward..."
Certainly.
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
It's good to see you, Holly.
I told the police.
Did the police believe you?
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
You've got plenty of contacts.
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
What did you expect me to be - part of your...
At the end of every chapter --
Coming to the point, please.
I understand...
Must be some mistake.
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Yes.
You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
I am not a bad man.
Never.
Oh.
Okay.
Help you out?
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
There is one problem.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
Yes.
It's on an island that no one get to.
You can swim?
Eh - bonsoir.
Not too bad.
I think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
How come you don't know it?  How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about --
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
Are they still together?
Is he a Nazi?
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
Why?
I'm good at languages.
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
What'd you say?
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Female...
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
So you're saying it's not true.
Explain it so I can.
Who killed Manzetti?
The arguments, anyway.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Ilio Manzetti...former ambassador to France. Managing partner at Damon, Schwarzchild.
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
I've got to get back to the --
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
Mrs. Moebius.
Where?
Get out of my way.
You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
How?
The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son?
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
Yes...
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What else is there?
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
How many are, down there?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
It isn't lit yet.
Try speaking to me?
Yes, I know.
You're the best, Enzo!
What room have you got?
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
You're staying at the hotel?
... And his friend, Johana...
Everything about what?
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
I don't want to erase anything.
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out.  They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere.  If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
Positive, Sir.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
What?
Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
I brought Johana to meet you.
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
How was your trip?
No.  I'm just depressed.
But... how is he going to breathe?
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
What's your first move?
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
Sure. Why not.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it.
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Take a look.
Resting?
Good looking?
That's just it, Charlie. That's what I'm driving at. You could do anything in that time.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
You really think so, Charlie?
You found the leopard!
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
Oh, that's so interesting!
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter —whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
Thanks.
They do, but -- there are no lights out there —- they'll just be shadows -—
Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
I'm sure of it!
Makes no difference. Get him out!
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Yes. Do you mind?
Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
I’m afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brother’s in trouble.
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don’t. You might get confused speaking of things you don’t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you’ve done what we are paying you for.
Perhaps I should come back when you’re...
Who is Friedman?
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
I... Well, we’re burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but it’s late and with the funeral...
My brother hung himself.
Leon’s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon’s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I’d exceeded his expectations.
Why do I feel I needn’t answer that?
Five years of it. Surely, you’d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
Here we go again.
Where is that?
Should I?
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
You wouldn’t understand.
You’re a long way from home...
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
I’m sure I’ll find a way.
Did you not enter this country illegally?
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god’s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
May I have your phone number?
Tomorrow?
Where?
Where are the kids?
What kids?
Can I have the reception desk, please.
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Yes. But my boss reckons you’d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It’d cost you about £100 but he said it’d be worth it.  Of course, you’d need a partner to register. But that’s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that’s what they do to their employees, isn’t it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining people’s lives. Thanks for the lift!
Hello there. How’s the flat. I cleaned...
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn’t like to think I’d kept you waiting for nothing.
Recommended?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
When... I’m told he came here...
Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy’s education.
Anything at all. I presume you won’t want to take the boy with you when you’re finished?  There’s a £500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand?
Does it matter?
I don’t know what your problem is, but...
Shut up and drive!
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who can’t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
Have you?
I’ll be alone.
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Should I be?
Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
... No. In fact, I’d seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn’t getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn’t appeal to you...
Excuse me?
I hear you’re looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leon’s gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You don’t know Leon, do you?
Tu sais où me trouver.
If you can, send me a receipt.
Three...
That’s just it. The sonofabitch didn’t ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasn’t gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
So why didn’t he?
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
That’s the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what you’re up to, eh, French-fuck?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
Better today than tomorrow.
I thought you were an archer?
Good.
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Yes...
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
I'm staying, Jean.
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
Quite a few.
No, I... I never killed anyone!
And when was that?
Rouen is in English territory.  I have the right to do anything I like.  Take them away.
Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
Scared of a girl?
Well find some other way!  Be creative.  Tell them she fucks the devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why can't you say that?  Sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
I was so worried -- we've all been looking for you!  The English are everywhere!  O thank you, lord!
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
What about you?
Who are you?
The English??
Not long ago...
Last night.
Praying.
Yes.
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
He's feeling wonderful.
You're a fine judge of character, Charles.  It'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake.  But if she's not -- then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head.
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
... as always, majesty...
Yes.
That's enough!  You will answer the question... or face the consequences!
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
I know...
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
The wind will be with us!  Do as I say.
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Jeanne, look behind you.
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Here -- take this instead.
Not for long...
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
I... I never lied!
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
Because... I have to be alone!
Why would they?
God asked you to do something?
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
I agree...
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Yes...
No...
Yes, my lord.
I need to confess again.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
I want to be with him always...
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
Come in! come in!
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
He'll be back before curfew.
How will we sleep?
Believe me, they've picked him up.
What d'you mean, take the table away?
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
What's the matter with you all? Have you lost your sense of humour?
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
I know.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
If you need help...
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
It's a little cut, nothing.
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
To be deaf?
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
Baines is packing up?
Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him ... we have had some tears
The Alps.
Yes, it's unholy.
Yes
Yes, I thought that.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
You mean in signs?
No, not words.
Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
That's right.
I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. 
At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
No, no cops!
What makes you think you can trust him?  He didn't do shit.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
You think my play is bad?
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
Shove off, Duff.
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
They workin' for anybody?
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
Lonnegan after you, too?
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
If we ever get to it.
No, not a thing.
And?
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
See and raise five.
Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
Where's June today?
You move right along, don't ya.
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Okay, Tootsie.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.
I am after this race.
It's foolproof.  We got a partner downtown runs the central office of the Western Union.  Race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies.  All he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner.  Then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that's already been run.  It can't miss, unless the Western Union Dicks get onto it.
I don't know, figure something out.
With 20% coming off the top for me laying your bet.  Either way you end up with 40.
For fifteen years.
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
And if it isn't?
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
Tch-tch-tch --  Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant.  You wouldn't drive slowly, so you don't get a tip.
Macaulay.
I've got to see you alone!
Yes.
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
I know -- I know --
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
Ever heard of the Sullivan Act?
Who's is it?
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
When was that?
Why yes.
Goodbye.
Want to take a poke at him?
Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
I couldn't go near that woman.
I thought you said you weren't going there.
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
What did you do with the rest?
I never had it.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
I see.  I see.
He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money...  I give it to her and she gives it to him.
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
They'll want more than your word for that.
I am on the level. If I knew anything I'd....
This is your party.
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
Hello, baby.
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
Oh, this is Andy --
You got types?
Room service, please -
What are you drinking?
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
There's one coming.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
Well, didn't you?
Macaulay.
Yes.
All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
You wouldn't be a widow long.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
That's a fact.
Wynant's body?
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Yes.
I wish you'd tell me who.
I wish you'd tell me.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
I wouldn't know.  That time he caught me was a accident.  I led with my right.
Home!
Y-yes.
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
Oh, God.
I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.
Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Blow me.
I did it!  I got the box open.
Roger that.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
Millionaires, man.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
It looks like you're not doing anything.
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
He's not going to leave us.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
Forget Wes.
We can't just leave him.
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
Damn.
Okay.  Then we go this way.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on!
Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
Shi'ites, I think.
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Thanks.
Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
I don't know.
A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
For real?  A treasure?
You ever think about dying?
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
Yes!
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
Yeah, well, we're not.
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North.  Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
Too low.
Don't be so sure.
It's 3+27 hundred
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
No, look!  Three degrees from the central azimuth.
Get out of here, Leave me alone.
Right now.
No, I...
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
Yes.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
Just do it.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
Right.
I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Off the scale.
Right.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
What... ?
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
Nothing... just tired.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
Shut up!  Who is this?
Take him!
Reilly, what're you doing here?
Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
Shit. We're fucked.
C'mon, it's a quiet night.
Don't talk.
Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good, right?
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
I thought I told you--
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
I promised her she'd be safe.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Yes.
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
The type they marry.
Doc--!
I would start with cocktails.
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
Um-hum ...
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
M'sieu Monescu!
What time is it?
Gaston!
Two fifty-three, five--
What?
Certainly!
Spanish passports?
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Yes.
The pleasure is mine, madame.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
I'll be delighted.
Goodbye.
Like that?
Like that!
I <u>must</u> go.
I know it.
<u>Adolph</u>?
Adolph J. Giron.
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Yes--uh--
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
What is it, madame?
I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
Don't drop it Rose.
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
Sure. Count me in.
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
Almost as good as you.
Well I can.
You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
I know what ice fishing is!
You're crazy.
That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Is he your boyfriend?
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
You wouldn'ta jumped.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
He couldn't have.
See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
We'll find out.
You had it the entire time?!
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
I can explain--
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
Where's Lother?
Guess again, copper.
We'll be expecting you.
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
You work too fast for me, young man.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
Okay.
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
We coulda got two third-class!
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
My change.
A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred. 
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
Back is in New York.
So what?
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Are you happy?
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
Good-night, folks.
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
Good night!
I sincerely hope so--
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
Thank you.
Hey--you! Where you going?
Then why did you run away?
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
You whore!  You filthy whore!
Come and get him.
This brand.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
Say when.
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
But who was the Devil?
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
No...
All right, Doc...
When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
Run.  Take that girl and start Running.  Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By.  This time run and don't look Back and call it living.  Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt.  Live, Wyatt...  Live for me.
A which?
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
I laugh sometimes
Doesn't suit you.
How would you know?
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
I hate Sadie.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
You get lonely?
Really?  You sure?
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
Not anymore, not after this.
We'll see about that.
So he can tell the story.
I read this book, book on Spiritualism...
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Fine.  Better.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
They're carrying guns in town.
Yeah, and dangerous.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
Where can I find him?
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want -  Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy.
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
Shhhhh...
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
Gone fishing.
Fishing?
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
Something with an engine? Not oars?
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
She married a hockey player.
Of course.
Depends what number you write.
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
Have we met?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
Up.
Trust me.
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
Don't say it.
I didn't say when I want to die -
... Yes?
And number two?
Now.
Of course.
I understand.
A three-thousand ton frigate doesn't just vanish into thin air.
Remind me.
Captain Morton.
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
No -
My timing always was lousy.
Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
Fueled and waiting.
Kill him! Finish it!
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
Will the cruise set it off?
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
Like muddy waters?
You were in hell?
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.
Well, you just have to move further out.
How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick.
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
I'm worn out but won't you feel like you are taking in a stranger?
Well, I would appreciate that.
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
Good afternoon to you.
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
In some things. When we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a X.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends? They all smell of moth balls.
I was just trying to make conversation.
Where is Skip?
I'm sorry he got those birds.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
But Mom, I can't find him!
Right here in the van.
What?  What is it?
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
That's why.  Sid.
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
No.
Go away.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
We're not aiming for the truck!
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Oh no, Hannah!
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
You are a liar!
It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame!  Repeat!  Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Got it.
She'll have to learn.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
I'm cold.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
I've got a present for you...
H'm?
So did I.
We're too young.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda and the swan. See?
It's all right, Finn.
Nine thousand dollars.
What is he being charged with?
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
What?
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
Goodbye Arnie.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
She asked me not to.
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
No, not yet.
Honey, your father knows the President.
Caroline --
Hi.
Live with your parents?
Yes.
What's that mean?
I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
Winners don't do coke.  Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers?
When will you do it?
Nobody said shit, Eduardo --
I don't believe you.
Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test. I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors.
Yeah.
We agree.
What is the name of your informant?
So what's it doing in Tijuana?
It could mean that, yes.
It's possible.
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
Noriega is a criminal.
Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
Any idea how much?
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?
For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Out.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
No.
Too young for what?
What? Steady like?
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Exactly. I'm not wanting a cat, she says. Get to fuck, right. So there's Tommy stuck with this kitten. You can imagine what happened. The thing was neglected, pissing and shitting all over the place. Tommy was lying around fucked out of his eyeballs on smack or downers. He didn't know you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it?
No. Me Neither.
Aye.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
The only drawback, or at least the principal drawback, is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that -
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
It was my fucking television.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
you'll need one more hit.
Your favourite dish.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
Sounds great, Swanney.
Are you serious?
Doesn't it make you proud to be Scottish?
How long is it?
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
With a starship!
All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
Raise shields.
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
But he does seem familiar?
Yes, Captain?
I have a half brother.
Is what possible?
A "t."
What makes you think I won't turn us around?



Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
Why not?
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
Oh, that is beautiful. You've got the goods...
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
To warn him.
I'm certainly not.
Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
Yes, okay, exactement!
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
User requests are what computers are for.
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Well, isn't it -- ?
No good...they might block off the old chip.  This way.
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
It's too far!
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
It grows on you.
Good luck. You can't even think in here.
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
End of line.
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
You seem fine now.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
You're kidding.
Roger, One.  Rolling.
Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
Stay on him.
Okay.  Here she comes.
She's having an affair.
Put a tap on her phone.
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
The purse is still at the house.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
But you didn't.  Why not?
You're not going anywhere.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
Yes what?
Yeah, it was wild.
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
Uh huh.
Three days later, he called me. He told me to meet him at Overlook Park.
Well, maybe a little.
I needed to feel alive.  I wanted to do something...  outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed.  To be trusted.  To be special.
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
So now it's Tasker?  Not Renquist?
Fuck you.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
Something came over me, I just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  But I really can't take credit .  .  .
What is it you need me to do?
Use the gifts that Allah has given you.
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
You can't have just one.
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.  What do you think would taste good?
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You could have been a real dick.
Tell me about yourself.
Yes, I would.
What kinda music do you like?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
Do you get paid a lot?
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
You will?
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
What?
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
What?
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
How come?
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
You wanna get unhaunted?
Yeah.
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
He don't got no right to live.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
Get the fuck outta here!
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
You goin' out?
What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for "T.J. Hooker" the other day.
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
Is he big league?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
Really?
Want an animal cracker?
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!
You are the dumbest person in the world.
No. Not yet.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?
What?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
I'm your son.
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
That was a good fuckin' movie.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
You do.
This guy's gonna kill him.
You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.
Pussy love pink rocks.
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
What can I do?
Just put it in your purse.
Exactly room-mates.
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
You're right. It is.
No.
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
This is it, James...what you've been working for.
She's drawing attention to us, that's what she's doing. ... I don't know what you're up to this time, Mason, but you're gonna get us in deep shit!
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
And your only goal is...???
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
It won't help you.  You can't do anything about it.  You can't change anything.
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
I have to go.
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
You're sure?
I don't know -- I don't remember.
I...I...We need cash, James.
You... you left them a message?
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
You know -- your plan.
What...???
Plan?  What are you talking about?
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
You can't do that yourself?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . .
That a fact?
You don't fear death?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Next city you're in take it to a jeweler.  He won't give you less than four-hundred for it.
That's my morning's pay.
It will.
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
Just a car.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
You son of a bitch!
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
Accident.
I just drove in this morning.
You've been around.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
Such as?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
You know what I want.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
I can't.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
What are you talking about?
I wanted to talk.
Because I know you're full of shit.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
You could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls.
Don't yell at me!
I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
You killed a man for no reason!
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
Where the hell am I going to go?
It's . . . it's locked.
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
And you're not one to lie, are you?
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
I'm her husband.
Live there?
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
How do you know if you've never tried?
This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
About what you said this morning.
I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
You're talking like a mad man.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife . . .?
The time wasn't right.
You know what I mean.
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
Shut up.
Came close this time and it scares you.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
Liar.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
What?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Hello?  Hello!?  Operator, I got disconnected.  Hello . . .
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Nope.  No problems up the road.
You want something, old man?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
What?
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
I got things to do.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Talk?  About what?
You love her, but you hate her?
We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
How do you want it?
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
It's not what you think, Jake.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I've had time to get over it.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
You've been there?
Yeah, but it was shot.
We're closed.  Come back when the sun comes up.
You got the money?
Eh?
That's right on my way.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
I like that about me, beautiful.
Where you headed?
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
What do you do anyway?
What?
Nothing like a little liveliness.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
What about us?
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I could if I had Jake's money.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
<u>I don't know why</u>!
You could give me my gun back.
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
Where to?
But, in particular?
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
One way, or round trip?
30.55. Twenty more will get you back.
I'll fuckin' take it. To go.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
No baby, you got it wrong.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
There's someone in the house.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
You use your sleeve.
out again?
Jesus.
It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have.
Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you.
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here?
No.
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year?
No.
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh yeah.
That much, huh?
Well, uh... it ain't loaded.
Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
Is... is it... loaded?
Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.
Give it to him.
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
What?
He's... he's dead.
A sign on him?
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
He hit you?
You're marking us, Bill.
HEY, KID.
HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Well, that's good now, ain't it, Bill? Seein' Claudia an...?
Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear?
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
Well, suppose he does?
They want more time to think about investing.
Edie, please.
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be ready - which brings me to sunny spot number two. Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing.
I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
Tough break.
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
Hungarian?
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
Who is he?
Two hours, tops.
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
Keaton was a piece of shit.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much.
You got him wrong.
Right.
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
Where's your head, Agent Kujan? Where do you think the pressure's coming from? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now. He's got the front burner under' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later. Immunity was just to deal with you assholes. I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.
Give a guy a break, huh?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
I don't have a minute. Are you saying it was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you didn't know who it was.
I don't know what you're talking about.
YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
Edie.
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
Immunity.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
I'm fine.
How good's your intelligence?
Very good.
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
... tell me about this case.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
What book is that?
...of Anesthesiology?
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
I wouldn't do it.
Just now...
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
I...
That's not my handwriting.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did?  Do you know what you did?
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
What you thought!?  What you thought...I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
You're going to settle out of court?
) I'm sorry ...?
Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
... that's perfectly all right.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I've got nothing to say to you.
Nothing happened.
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
Thank you for seeing me.
The TV didn't work.
I've got to work.
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
And what makes you so tough?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Stop pressuring me...
What are you going to do?
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
He's not in, Sir.
I'm going to help her.
...he's a good man...
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Right.
I'm going to get laid.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
What did she do?
How old are you, how many children ... when did you last eat ...
...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
... You saw her?
... fifty thousand dollars?
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Yes.
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
How old is he?
Who told you that?
Yes.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
The Big Boy did...?
Almost a year.
And you like it.
Well?
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Ernie's.
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
What about?
You're not far wrong.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
I told you! Right here!
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
No? Then what?
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
They're none of them right.
Judy --
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
No, it's all right.
To complete my cure.
But why? Why here?
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
What are you going to do?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
I enjoyed talking to you.
Shopping?
No.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
No, thank you.
Here with you.
Where?
Why did you jump?
Home?
Where?
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
All the time.
I had the dream. The dream came back again...
Yes --
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
Yes.
You can't.
Where?
How long has she had the room?
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
I had to quit, Midge.
I know. Everybody tells me.
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
That's following a train of thought.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
How?
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Who?
For what?
By whom?
Don't touch her. Call 911.
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
What?
Multiple reasons.
What are you fucking talking about?
Eat my ass!
Go home!
What?
You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
Watch the tone fella.
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
I got children. I've got a life.
They're driving me nuts!
Later.
Are you solid with that?
I know and I'm honored...
What happened? Oh my God...
We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
Shut up Boyd! Micheal?
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
Great. Fine. Perfect.
Shut up.
So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
Now?
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
True.
You have a King fantasy.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
And what happens when you can't?
Take Mexico.
They need leadership.
Give me the Valium.
Yup.
Why?
I wouldn't know.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
I just don't see him in the big picture.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
You expect more what?
Time out.
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
Kiss me...?
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Have a nice bachelor party.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
How late?
I'm working on it.
We're not canceling.
Don't even.
What kind of stupid question is that?
Who's dead?
Call the police.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes...  Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.
I don't hear it.
The stone age.
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
No.
Who is she?
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
Whatever you like.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
Yes, sir. Good night.
That's it.
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
But why? Why?
You should have enough to do in this house ... Come here and listen to this.
Where's the dough?
She's left.
And let him get run over by somebody else?
What's he called?
A black bull!
I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
Can you tell us what's on the disc?
Why wasn't I told?
Catch him and your record's clean.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar —— you making it okay in there?
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Where's my gun?
You son—of—a—bitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
Don't blame yourself. In your shoes, I don't think I would have told Parker, either.  So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality?
Captain, I'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is.  But I'm even more afraid of what's he's becoming.
Only because I got pulled out early.
Not from in here.
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
I'M WHAT?!
This is supposed to be years away.
How should I know?
Talk so I can understand.
Should I have?
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
I had something a little different in mind.  Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly, why don't you get him to show you what he's been working on after hours?
Glad to...
A little less than yesterday.
That's not true, Parker.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son—of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
You know I am.
You like baseball?
Part of him is.
I'm not sure...on the bridge...the guy at the payphone...
Thanks.
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go —— right now.  Why are you going to do this?
Lindenmeyer?
You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
My...secret.
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
What if he's busy tonight?
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
For Schumann.
Hello, <u>King</u>.  How the heck <u>are</u> you...?  <u>Get</u> out...  <u>Get</u> out... Well, man, you fall in love like a <u>Hillbilly</u>...  Ditch the wife, toss the kids in the Pick-up,   Listen, King:  <u>Get</u> your fat redneck ass out here, <u>willya</u>...
What can it hurt.
...can we have a white one...?
What'd ya think?
Much more...uh, he have much more time to "serve?"
...and...

What are you talking about?
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
Don't you want to know if it's true?
The American "people"?
Why?
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
Why?
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
The Ribbon Manufacturers.
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
...Stanley Moss...
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
Could we have you in here, please...7
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD.  IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE.
The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour.
Six to five and pick'em...you wanna <u>chance</u> it...
My name is Ronald Brean.
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
Why do people go to war?
Why do people go to war?
I have.
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
...Good...
Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
When's he coming back...?
Party's gonna need more than a couple bucks now.
How you going to stretch it?  This won't hold for eleven days.  Guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
...going to War...
Yes.  Indeed I did. 
"The Country Is At War." 
Lots n lotsa cash.  Stay on for Gracie, she'll get you a ticket 
The men and women of Detachment Three-O-Three, with their...
The war ain't over til I <u>say</u> it's over.  This is <u>my</u> picture.  You think you're in a <u>spot</u>?  You think this is a tight spot?  Try making the Hunchback of Notre Dame when your three lead actors <u>die</u>, two weeks from the end of Principal Photography.  This is... this is... this is just...  Act One:  THE WAR. Act <u>Two</u> ... the... uh...
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
They got him standing by.
Oh, you're gonna love this:
Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
Well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring Peace.
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>... 
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
Get on your feet, boy.
Prouder of this, than anything I ever did in my life. I want to thank you, Ron.  Want to thank you.
I'm looking for a phone...
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that.
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money?
Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...
Why are they ...
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
We had Davy Crockett hats, but you could <u>crush</u>'em ... you could <u>crush</u>'em, see, when you felt stupid. Crush'em, put em in your Pocket.  You can't put a Mountie hat in your...
...they have the capacity to Meld into the <u>Woods</u>, and...
...of kittens...
Show some compassion.
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
They don't know what's going on!
Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
...you take that Anacott Steel?
All right, I owe you one Marv.
Hey the door was open.
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
What are you doing here?
What if they call him?
It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you.
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
...I can't even see it...
Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
I remember that deal. You were involved?
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Gordon.
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see.
Why?
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy. 
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
With Mark?
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
Suffer?  We're living in America.
Hmm.
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
I know what you mean.
Come on.
That's not what you said last night.
Right.
Hi there Sarah
They're all human beings
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
What does she look like?
What do you think I should do?
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
Is everything alright?
I'm not...
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
That's not...It's not like that.
No, I don't.
It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
Of course.
Okay, I'm a little tender.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
Please.
I was down in Adamant...
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
Jody he was lying.
I think three...
Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
Yep.
It's okay if you're not.
Mmm.
Unless you need me to come home...
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
Of course.
I don't know.  Just...whispering.
"...for my father."
What's going on, Claire?
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
I didn't do that.
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
Five minutes?
No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
What are you...?  No.
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
Since when?
What?
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
Get out of my way.
Okay.  Don't...you don't understand what this is.
Shhhh.
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
A spacial entity.  An organized energy.  something that precedes our definition of existence.
I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
What are you talk---
Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
I under5tand.  All the same
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
There are things I have to know!
You're a monster.
uh - then he - be just -
Lie...?
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
Rowan...
No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
He fools around with his patients too.
Captain's orders.
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...?
So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
A bit much.    Lucas.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
Just don't fall off any ladders.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
Yes it is...
That's right...
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
Tell me - ELLEN CARTER  Forgive me for being so pushy, but aren't you a novelist? Didn't you write that terrific book - 'The Color of Fear'?
The touch?
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
Don't worry - Is that my hammer  Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage...
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
I don't want to talk about it -
I don't know...
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
I have something I have to show you...
That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...
Yes - I suppose so...
CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
What's this all about?
And not just any novelist - a great novelist - it was an impressive piece of work ELLEN...
Oh...
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
Give me those!
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
These are real, live women?
From your lips, to God's ears.
If you don't have...I mean...
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces.  Are you hungry?
The lesson being?
Well, good. Every little bit helps.
Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores.
Whatever you want.
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
I meant biologically.
I didn't forget.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
I doubt it.
Eventually you'll let go.
If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
Let's do it.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
Yellow pages?
I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
Like what?
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
You think we should be more open minded?
That's perfect.
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
It's about your parents.
I have the feeling, they got it down already.  They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
No.
Maybe she used another name.
If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
Where's Lombardo?
Yeah.
What was that?
You didn't cuff her?
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
I said he did.
You are.
Whichever one I want.
No thanks to you.
No you don't.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
Just like that?  These people ruined your life, bro.
You can't...
You, Kelly, Sam.
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Put them all together and what do we have?
"Ay, there's the rub."  Take a look at this file on Professor Morton.  Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Prepare what?
All that jumping and kicking.
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
Oh, thank you.
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
Well, sure.  Didn't you get your orders?
You?  Dr. Pemberton?  Of course. How novel.
Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
I try.  Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case.
Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
You're not going to use it, are you?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
He's no magician.
He turned that monster into stone!
I will!  But I need help!
Miserable Pecks.
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic- tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world.
Of course!  I promise!
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Want me to carry Elora?
I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
The limitless power of...
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
Me!
She's too powerful, Raziel
Somebody has to do it.
Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
Maybe milking.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Sure have, Sam.
What have you got?
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
Who else knows?
Don't try me, Johnny!
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Home.
But why?
But you can't.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
That's your way, not mine.
Say again?
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
John said you're Amish.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
No... No. It is just the English way.
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
If any!
You'll be hist...
Hickory!
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
Oh, please give me back my dog!
No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
Catch him, you fool!
Oh!  Well....
Oh, now?
No, they won't - honestly.
Oh, no -- no!
But you couldn't have been, could you?
What sort of an animal is that?
You've had plenty of time already!
Yes...!
Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Ohh!
They would?
Here -- here --
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Leave her alone!
Oh, you did it yourself!
I -- Oh --
Yeah. Me?
That's right.
Now...
Why don't you try counting sheep?
That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
You mean she bit you?
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
You know something?
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And M’s life is part of the bet.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
Is maybe...the inside woman.
Which is neutral, no doubt.
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Haven’t you heard the news?  So is she.
That’s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think I can’t do it. You think I’m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
Someone wants to kill me, I’d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
Shush.
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat’s nest.
I thought you were the one in her business.
Why?  What's the problem?
I would like to use the bathroom --
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
No idea who's behind this?
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
What's your theory?
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
I won't do that.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Jon -- what??
The south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.
No.  I just wanted you to --
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
What are you up to?
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
What new information?
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
What do you mean, frame-up?
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
With lots of ketchup?
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
We should get back --  What?
-- What?
I don't know their real names!
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
I'm sorry about Blake.
What is this place?
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
Yeah, I spy or I die.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
We don't have that kinda time, boss, I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill.
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
Like what?
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
I was invited. What's your story?
Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
Aren't you afraid?
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
I thought that was in detail.
I'm through, Xander.
You're serious?
The corner. Anarchy 99.
You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
This is a gift. From me to you.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
Its core?
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
He takes himself seriously.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
Let's just say, God works too slowly.
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
I...
You have your tickets?
Whatever makes you happy.
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
This is the only library I know of.
Fron kon steen!
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Vermicelli.
How old are you, young man?
Nineteen, sir.
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
I'm sure we will.
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
Yes, just the two.
I beg your pardon?
I wonder what's got into them?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
How?
More, do you hear me?
You're right!  Self-pity never got anyone anywhere.  Let's go back and finish our dinner.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
You can say that again.
How do you know it was a 'she'?
What???
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!

Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
